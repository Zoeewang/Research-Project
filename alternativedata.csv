interest deposits and ongoing shifts from compensating balances to fees to pay for services .  because of the higher interest elasticities of m1 , a range about twice the width of those for m2 and m3 would be needed to encompass the same set of possible outcomes for income and interest rates .  thus a range for m1 of 3 to 9 percent would appear consistent with alternative b , placing expected m1 growth a little below the midpoint of its range , as would be the case for m2 under this alternative .  alternatives i and iii would seem to be consistent with m1 ranges of a percentage point more and less ,  respectively.2 2 . m1a  might increase at about 4 - 1/2 percent over the year .  over an annual horizon , m1a is less interest elastic than m2 , but given uncer- tainties about the behavior of demand deposits in recent years , a 3 percentage point range might also be appropriate for this aggregate , should the committee choose to set one .  an m1a range consistent with alternative  ii might be 3 - 1/2 to 6 - 1/2 percent , with 1/2 of a percentage point more or less for alternatives i and iii respectively .  short - run policy alternatives  three short - run policy alternatives are presented for con- sideration by the committee .  current reserve and money market conditions would be maintained under alternative b while alternatives a  and c would involve somewhat easier or somewhat tighter conditions , respectively .  the level of adjustment plus seasonal borrowing associated with alternative b , $ 250 million , is expected to entail federal funds trading around recent 6 - 1/2 to 6 - 3/4 percent levels .  such a relationship between borrowing and the funds rate would be broadly consistent with recent behavior but would involve a lower amount of borrowing than indicated by model relationships , reflecting some continued unusual reluctance by banks to borrow from the window .  remaining uncertainties about the borrowing relationship , as well as lingering sensitivities in financial markets , might call for some continued flexibility in implementing open market operations .  alternative  a would be associated with a reduction in the federal funds rate of about 1/2 percentage point -- achieved by a lowering of the borrowing objective to $ 100 million , a near - frictional level -- or by a 1/2 percentage point cut in the discount rate .  alternative  c would be associated with an increase in the borrowing objective to about $ 450 million and a rise in the federal funds rate of approximately 1/2 percentage point .  although market participants may be uncertain as to whether a reduction in reserve pressures has already occurred , the structure of market interest rates suggests that some easing has already been discounted .  with federal funds around the 6 - 5/8 percent area , the three - month treasury bill rate would likely fluctuate around or a little above its recent 5 - 5/8 percent level .  this bill rate is unusually low relative to the expected funds rate , but public supplies of treasury bills continue to be reduced by treasury paydowns .  rates on private money market instruments also would be expected to remain around current reduced levels prompting another 1/4 percentage point cut in the prime rate as the spread between the prime and money market yields still remains wide after this week 's reduction .  the recent rally in alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates m2 m3 m1 alt .  c levels in billions monthly growth rates 1988 january  9.8 9.8 9.8 8.3 8.3 8.3 13.3  c quarterly ave .  growth rates chart 1 actual and targeted m2 billions of dollars actual level short -

1/4 percent in the current quarter as the response of demand to the drop in interest rates since october more than offsets the effects of slower income growth .  consequently , m2 velocity would decline at around a 1 per- cent rate -- the first drop in more than a year .  from its fourth - quarter base , m2 by march would advance at a 6 - 1/2 percent annual rate , the midpoint of its tentative long - run range .  within m2 , rate relationships would tend to increase the attractiveness of the more liquid interest - earning com- ponents owing to the stickier adjustment of their offering rates following the recent declines in market rates .  from the fourth quarter , m1 by march would rise at a 5 - 3/4 percent rate .  m3 , under alternative b , would advance at a 6 percent annual rate from november to march as growth over february and march strengthens somewhat from the 5 percent average of december and january .  by march , m3 would be 6 - 1/4 percent above its fourth - quarter base , also near the center of the tentative range .  inflows to core deposits at banks and thrifts are likely to fall short of credit demands , leading both types of institutions to issue a moderate volume of managed liabilities in m3 .  credit growth at banks is expected to slow somewhat in february and march from its exceptional january pace , which was boosted by a resurgence of security lending .  overall credit growth is forecast to increase slightly over coming months , reflecting primarily a pickup in borrowing by the federal government from its recent reduced pace .  a continued wide financing gap along with a quickening pace of corporate acquisitions and restructurings are expected to give rise to sizable business credit demands .  in addition to heavier borrowing from banks and in the commercial paper market , businesses are expected to tap the bond markets to avail themselves of reduced long - term borrowing costs .  by march domestic nonfinancial debt is expected to be around 9 percent above its fourth - quarter base , also in the middle of its tentative range ."

related balances also have considerably smaller impacts on m2 than on m1 .  the latter was boosted more substantially in april by the temporary build - up of transactions depos- its and will be more affected by the rise in interest rates as depositors shift funds from ocds into small time deposits , whose yields adjust more promptly to market rates .  growth in m1 is projected to drop below 3 percent on average over may and june from 11 -

related and other special borrowing , and households may tap consumer credit and home equity lines to a lesser extent in coming months with the scaling back of auto incentives and the passing of the april tax date .  at thrifts , however , the restraining effects on asset expansion of the recent upturn in mortgage rates will be cushioned some by a growing share of arms .  total household borrowing over the remainder of the quarter is expected to edge down , while overall business credit demands should remain robust into the summer given the elevated financing gap and continuing merger activity .  but with federal government borrowing light over the rest of the second quarter , the growth in the debt of all domestic nonfinancial sectors by june is expected to be moving closer to , though still staying a little above , the 9 percent mid- point of the committee 's annual range ."

end pressures in the funds market and the scope for changing expectations of near - term policy actions add to this uncertainty over coming weeks .  under alternative b , a borrowing objective of $ 400 million would be retained , and federal funds would be expected to settle mainly into an 8 - 3/8 to 8 - 1/2 percent range , though slightly higher rates are possible through year - end .  alternative  c incor- porates an increase in intended discount borrowing to $ 600 million , with the federal funds rate likely to move up to around 8 - 7/8 to 9 percent .  similar conditions in the funds market also could be engendered through a 1/2 point rise in the discount rate to 7 percent , while keeping borrowing at $ 400 million .  these relations assume that most , though perhaps not all , of the recent shortfall in borrowing will persist ; smaller banks may well remain less willing to tap the discount window , but large bank borrowing , while subject to the usual vicissitudes of computer problems , could return toward normal once the year - end , with its anticipated money market pressures , is past .  short - term market interest rates are likely to retreat some-  what under alternative b . these rates now embody some near - term firming of policy , and as funds ease back a bit from their recent trading range and as no subsequent tightening move materializes , short - term rates are likely to drop .  the 3-month treasury bill rate should fall from around the recent 8 percent level to 7 - 3/4 percent or even below .  the extent of any decline could be damped for a time , however , reflecting the effects of normal year- end activity and a potential surge in credit demands associated with corporate restructuring over coming months .  these developments will have their greatest impact on short - term rates , especially in light of the large volume of bank financing of equity retirements .  any declines in long - term alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates alt .  c levels in billions 1988 october 1989 january monthly growth rates 1988 october  1989 january quarterly ave .  growth rates 1988 q1 1989 q1 1988  target ranges :  1989 ranges ( tentative ) :  chart 1 actual and targeted m2 billions of dollars  actual level sshort -

yielding balances for long .  for m2 , any such effects are ex- pected to dissipate over the first quarter as funds are redeployed .  even though short - term rates might drop from recent levels under this alterna-  tive , they would remain above those of late summer and early fall .  this net advance in interest rates and deposit opportunity costs coming on top of the earlier increases would damp m2 demand in the first quarter about as strong- ly as it was restrained in the second half of this year .  based on the greenbook forecast for gnp , m2 velocity is expected to rise at a 4 percent annual rate in the first quarter , near its estimated pace in each of the last two quarters of 1988 .  m3 growth of 7 percent at an annual rate is anticipated from november to march under alternative b , somewhat above the average of the last two months .  this aggregate should accelerate around year - end , spurred by massive lbo and merger financing requirements , which will require a sub- stantial pickup in managed liabilities , including large cds .  however , m3 growth is expected to moderate to around 6 -

1/2 to 10 - 1/2 percent range for 1989 .  net equity retirements over these four months are projected at a record pace , with business borrowing at banks and in the commercial paper market bearing the brunt of the outsized credit demands .  abstracting from the effects of the pickup in equity retirements , business borrowing would be expected to con- tinue at about the pace of earlier this year .  in the household sector , mortgage borrowing is likely to continue near the pace of the last few quarters as home sales are anticipated to hold close to recent levels for several months , especially to the extent that interest rates stabilize or ease off under alternative b . consumer credit growth may pick up  tempo- rarily early next year if , as expected , auto makers step up their sales promotions to boost demand .  the federal government is expected to increase further its issuance of coupon securities , now that the treasury has long- bond authority , but as seasonal financing needs ease with a pickup of tax receipts , the treasury is expected to lessen net bill issuance .  state and local government offerings are likely to stay relatively subdued , though any tendency for rates to drop under this alternative might foster a renewed interest in refunding outstanding debt ."

Markets also may be particularly sensitive to clues about the Federal Reserve's policy strategy around the cycle trough; the unchanged policy stance of alternative B--if maintained through the intermeeting period in the absence of clear evidence of a trough--could be seen as incorporating a more cautious policy approach to assuring an upturn.

3/4 percent average rate over may and june , a considerable pickup from recent months.6  some of the strength in may , and to a lesser extent in june , reflects reversals of previous temporary depressants involving tax effects , the late - winter lull in mortgage refinancing activity , and seasonal - adjustment distortions.7 apart from effects of these temporary factors , underlying m2 probably will exhibit a speed- up over the two months , owing to an abatement of the more fundamental influences that had boosted its velocity to a 5 - 3/4 percent growth rate over the previous two quarters .  quarterly average growth of m2 for the second quarter is projected at about a 1 - 1/2 percent rate , with temporary factors having little net impact .  thus , with nominal gdp expected to rise at about a 4 - 1/4 percent rate , m2 velocity would increase at only about a 2 - 1/2 percent pace .  if the money market condi- tions of this alternative were maintained over the summer , m2 growth would be expected to move up still nearer to that of nominal gdp in the third quarter .  m3 under alternative b is seen as accelerating to about a 4 percent rate over may and june .  this speedup would stem solely from the pickup in m2 , as managed liabilities in m3 , including large time deposits , should resume running off over the two months .  bank credit expansion is expected to remain moderate , with loan growth quite weak , 6 . m1 is projected to rise at an 18 percent annual rate from april to june .  the expansion in m1 deposits should show through in rapid growth in required reserves , and total reserves would be expected to expand at a 19 - 1/4 percent annual rate from april to june .  with currency growth anticipated at 11 percent over the two months , the monetary base would rise at an 11 - 1/4 percent pace .  this year 's seasonal adjustment factors for february and march appear to be elevated artificially by the influence of system easing actions around year - end 1990 and 1991 rather than evolving seasonal patterns .  and the balance sheets of thrift institutions are anticipated to con- tinue to contract .  while inflows of core deposits are projected to meet most of the added funding needs of banks and s&ls , banks are likely to obtain some funding from abroad and from other nondeposit sources , in part to avoid higher deposit insurance premiums .  looking further ahead , moderate average growth of m3 during the third quarter would be expected to accompany retention of the specifications of alternative b over that period .  households and businesses are expected to stay cautious in using credit in coming months .  in the household sector , mortgage refinancing activity is likely to remain brisk .  overall mortgage debt , however , is expected to expand at about its first - quarter pace , as cash- out refinancing activity continues to be limited and home purchases rise only gradually .  growth of consumer credit is projected to remain moderate , despite heavy promotion of credit cards with rebates and other incentives .  given still -

-uncertainties that have been heightened by the earthquake and severe weather .  nevertheless , most anticipate a tightening within a few months as incoming data suggest only a limited slowing in economic growth and a cessation of disinflation .  as the intermeeting period progresses , economic data along the lines of the staff forecast might put modest upward pressure on short - term interest rates as the time of expected tightening approaches , but would induce little systematic movement in longer - term rates .  the exchange value of the dollar also is likely to trade in a relatively narrow range around current levels .  m2 growth likely will be held down under alternative b by a reversal of the previous bulge attributable to mortgage refinanc-  ing activity , which had boosted average m2 growth by an estimated 1 percentage point during the october through december months , before becoming a minor drag in january .  over the february -

The 50-basis-point hike in the funds rate would be seen by market participants as motivated importantly by a desire to bolster the dollar, which might well recover some of its recent losses, especially if the action were implemented through a hike in the discount rate. If the dollar did rebound and the action were seen as lowering the odds on a pickup of inflation, any increases in bond yields could be quite limited. On the other hand, such an action is not currently anticipated in the
market and could prompt increased uncertainty about the future path of interest rates, with adverse effects on bond and possibly stock markets. In any case, banks would be likely to match the increase in the federal funds rate with a similar hike in the prime rate."

This step could be judged as more suited to the strength of the emerging threat that the economy may be overshoot- ing its potential, setting in motion a gradual self-reinforcing pro- cess of increasing inflation. Under these circumstances, a more decisive move toward restraint would be needed to avoid an upward ratcheting of inflation. Market sentiment has deteriorated during the hiatus in policy tightening, judging by the rise in bond yields and weakness in the exchange value of the dollar. By more clearly notch- ing up monetary policy to a firmer posture, a larger step might better assure market participants that the Federal Reserve was acting force- fully enough to head off future inflation and might forestall the perceived need on the part of the market participants for another tightening move this year. If so, the action could spur a near-term rally in bond markets and strengthen the dollar. Some increases in very short-term market interest rates would likely result, of course, from the somewhat larger-than-expected rise in the funds rate, and banks could immediately raise their prime rate by a comparable amount."

in any case , the chances of such problems will be even more remote after year - end .  as noted above , market participants now assess the probability of a near - term tightening as fairly low , but they see an intermeeting move before the next scheduled fomc meeting on january 31 and february 1 as more likely .  in these circumstances , and given the seemingly greater confidence of late in financial markets that the system will act as appropriate to counter a buildup in inflationary pressures , interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar are unlikely to change very much in the immediate aftermath of a deci- sion to leave policy unchanged , as under alternative b . movements in financial markets subsequently will depend , of course , on the nature of incoming data .  continued strength in employment or final demand , especially if accompanied by adverse wage and price developments , would firm market expectations of system action early next year .  inaction in the face of such data could risk the re - emergence of con- cerns that the federal reserve was falling behind in its efforts to contain inflation , raising long - term interest rates and weakening the foreign exchange value of the dollar .  under alternative b , m2 would strengthen to a 1 - 1/4 percent rate over the november - to - march period .  opportunity costs of holding m2 - -especially the small time deposit and money market mutual funds components -- should narrow from current high levels as retail deposit and money fund rates continue to adjust upward to recent in- creases in market rates .  as a result , growth in m2 velocity would slow to a 5 percent rate in the first quarter of next year from a 7 percent rate in the current quarter .  m1 would continue to edge down- ward in response to previous increases in opportunity costs , although the drag from the slowdown of mortgage refinancing activity will be diminishing as such activity stabilizes at relatively low levels.7 boosted in part by faster growth in m2 , m3 would be expected to grow at a 2 - 1/4 percent rate over the november - to - march period .  in addition , a pickup in m3-type money market mutual funds , as rates on such funds catch up with market rates , would act to lift m3 growth .  with the deposit components of m1 contracting over the november - to - march period , total reserves would fall at a 5 percent annual rate .  in contrast , the monetary base would rise at a 6 percent pace , supported by the growth of currency .  alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates  m2 m3 m1 alt .  c levels in billions monthly growth rates quarterly averages growth rate from to 1994 target ranges : 1 to 5 0 to 4 1995 target ranges : 1 to 5 0 to 4 ( provisional ) chart 2 actual and targeted m2 billions of dollars - actual level short - run alternatives on d chart 3 actual and targeted m3 billions of dollars -- actual level short - run alternatives  j ' ' '' ' ' ' '' ' chart 4 - actual level short - run alternatives -5%-i  j billions of dollars 10%- 1220 chart 5 debt billions of dollars - actual level projected level on d  j bank issuance of large cds is expected to remain brisk , despite some moderation in loan growth , as bank reliance on nondeposit funding continues to abate ."

(26) The decision to leave reserve market conditions un- changed, as under alternative B, might be favored if the staff economic forecast, which assumes a constant federal funds rate through early 1996, were viewed as both a reasonable and desirable outcome.

in past monetary policy reports , the committee has noted that the 1-to-5 percent range for m2 provided a benchmark for longer - run growth that could be expected under conditions of reasonable price stability if that aggregate 's velocity resumes its historical pattern of no long - term trend .  short - run policy alternatives -- under alternative b , the intended federal funds rate would be maintained at 6 percent .  the decision to leave reserve market conditions  un- changed , as under alternative b , might be favored if the staff economic forecast , which assumes a constant federal funds rate through early 1996 , were viewed as both a reasonable and desirable outcome .  in that forecast , near - term weakness is limited -- about sufficient to bring the economy down to the level of its potential .  an unemployment rate in the vicinity of its natural rate is restored by the third quarter , thereby nipping in the bud any tendency for inflationary momentum to build .  the declines in real longer - term rates and the exchange rate that have already occurred , along with the rise in equity prices , stimulate final sales sufficiently to return growth close to the rate of its potential by late in 1995 , holding the un- employment rate about constant .  however , monetary policy still is a little to the restrictive side in the greenbook forecast , leaving a small amount of slack in the economy over time .  against this back- drop , and with very recent indicators suggesting a limit to near - term weakness , the committee may wish to see macroeconomic data accumulate that call the staff forecast into question before deciding to ease policy .  over the past few days , markets have come to view policy action at this meeting as much less likely , and interest and exchange rates probably would change little with the choice of alternative b , though a further small backup in yields can not be ruled out with the disappointment of some residual expectations of prompt easing .  mar- kets are likely to view data over the intermeeting period consistent with the staff forecast as mixed ; broad measures of production and employment would continue to the soft side , with the unemployment rate moving higher and inflation lower than in the first half , but in-  dicators of sales should show some firming tendencies .  in these cir- cumstances , market participants likely would continue to see inflation risks as more muted and an intermediate - term policy ease as still a possibility . -- that is , the financial market conditions associated with the unchanged policy of alternative b , including the backup in long - term rates in the staff forecast , might be seen as unnecessarily risking weak spend- ing ."

and , at this stage of the investment cycle and with consumers already having responded to their increased wealth , the odds on a marked upside surprise in final demand would seem to be lower than they might have appeared earlier .  moreover , the real federal funds rate has been rising this year from an already high level , owing to the committee 's firming of policy in march and the apparent decline in inflation expectations since then , providing some assurance that policy is not substantially too accommodative .  financial aggregates could be read in the same light , with both m2 and debt , the two aggregates most closely related to nominal gdp , expanding moderately.3 in the staff forecast , the rise in inflation is gradual , so that once the potential for an upswing in inflation became more clearly evident , the committee should have time to act before the economy 's long - run health were seriously threatened .  indeed , whether the structure of the economy has changed in ways that make it somewhat less inflation - prone , at least for a time , than allowed for by the staff projection remains an open question .  market participants uniformly do not expect a near - term policy move by the federal reserve , and selection of alternative b by the committee should elicit little imme- diate market reaction .  thus , short - term interest rates generally would remain close to current levels , as would the foreign exchange value of the dollar , though treasury bill rates could continue to edge up as supply constraints ease further with the seasonal widening of the 3 the relatively brisk advance of m3 seems to be driven primarily by the funding choices of depositories and well as shifts in business cash management practices favoring money funds , both of which bear little relationship to cyclical pressures .  federal deficit .  in longer - term markets , prices are likely to remain more volatile than over the spring and early summer as participants assess incoming data for clues about whether the recent exceptional confluence of strong growth , high levels of resource utilization , and low inflation can persist .  however , data over the intermeeting period consistent with the staff forecast would likely prove somewhat reassuring in this regard , because they would show the economy growing at a moderate pace and inflation remaining damped .  in these circum- stances , long - term yields could move lower over the weeks ahead .  under the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b , m2 is projected to grow at a moderate 4 - 1/2 percent rate on average over the remaining months of the year , around the expected rate of expansion of nominal gdp , leaving this aggregate a little below the upper limit of its 1 to 5 percent growth range for the year .  the increase in m3 is likely to slow somewhat , as factors that have temporarily been boosting managed liabilities in that aggregate dissipate , but m3 growth will probably continue to be fueled by a shift in institu- tional cash management toward money market funds .  this aggregate is expected to finish the year more than a percentage point higher than its 2 to 6 percent annual range , somewhat above the staffs projection in the july bluebook .  although the federal government will shift to being a net borrower in credit markets over the balance of the year , the growth of its debt will be restrained by the narrow deficit .  at the same time , the level and pattern of borrowing by private sectors is not anticipated to change significantly , producing moderate growth in the debt of all nonfinancial sectors -- near the middle of its 3 to 7 percent range and in line with nominal gdp .  alternative levels and growth rates for key monetary aggregates alt .  c levels in billions  jun-97 jul-97 aug-97 sep-97 oct-97 nov-97 dec-97  monthly growth rates  jul-97 aug-97 sep-97 oct-97 nov-97 dec-97 quarterly averages 97 q1 97 q2 97 q3 97 q4 growth rate from to jul-97 dec-97 96 q4 jul-97 96 q4 dec-97 95 q4 96 q4 96 q4 97 q4  chart 2 actual and projected m2 billions of dollars - actual level short - run alternatives jun aug  i chart 3 actual and projected m3 billions of dollars  actual level short - run alternatives  jun aug dec chart 4 actual and projected debt billions of dollars - actual level projected level jun augdec directive language"

Domestic spending continues to be supported by very favorable conditions in debt and equity markets. The decline in long-term rates should spur spending, in part as borrowers free cash flow by refinancing higher cost debt. In this environment, counting on Asian developments to defuse enough of the momentum in the economy may be viewed as too risky, especially as the rebound in Asian stock markets and in commodity prices may suggest that limits to Asian turmoil may be in sight. In response to the tightening, short-term rates would rise by at least the 25 basis point increase in the federal funds rate.

the financing gap is not projected to increase any further in coming quarters , and borrowing in recent months has been well above staff assessments of needs to cover mergers and acquisitions and the shortfall of internal funds from capital outlays .  while some new caution by lenders is likely to surface as economic growth slows and profits soften , this shift in attitudes is expected to have only a marginal restraining influence on business credit growth .  in the household sector , growth of debt is projected to continue to be well maintained -- outpacing that of disposable personal income - led by brisk mortgage borrowing as housing markets remain strong and as refinancing is associated with some further equity extraction .  by september , debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is projected to have grown at a 5 - 1/2 percent rate from its fourth quarter 1997 base , above the midpoint of its 3 to 7 percent annual range .  the moderation in the growth of the broad monetary aggregates under alternative b owes in part to a slowdown in gdp and bank credit as business lending and acquisitions of securities slacken and  banks become less aggressive in seeking funding .  nonetheless , m3 is projected to grow at a 6 - 1/4 percent annual rate over the march - to- september period as depository credit growth still stays fairly brisk .  as a consequence , m3 would stand 9 - 1/2 percent above its fourth - quarter base in june and 8 - 1/2 percent above that base in september .  growth in m2 is projected to slow to a 3 - 1/2 percent annual rate over the march - to - september period .  we are projecting that , in the absence of changes in opportunity costs , m2 growth in an underlying sense will return to a pace close to that of gdp in the period ahead .  nevertheless , v2 is expected to decrease in the second quarter because of the effects on liquid balances of the current heavy pace of mortgage refinancing , as well as the high levels of tax refunds and anticipated april tax payments ; in the third quarter , however , v2 is likely to rise somewhat , as those refinancing and tax effects on deposit levels are removed .  the deceleration in m2 brings growth from the fourth quarter of 1997 to june to a 6 - 1/2 percent pace , still above the 1 to 5 percent annual range for m2 , and to a 5 - 1/4 percent pace by september .  directive language"

Although that forecast has an underlying upward tilt to inflation in 1999 as -8- labor markets remain quite tight, that tilt is gradual and starts from a lower inflation rate in 1998 than the Committee had anticipated only a few months ago, judging from the central tendencies of members' CPI projections in February. 2 Even if the Committee were troubled by the underlying uptrend of inflation in the staff forecast, it might still be willing to adopt the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative B.

this projection embodies a 1 percent decline in velocity in 1998 .  projected m3 growth under alternative b would dip to a 5 - 1/2 percent rate from april through september , reflecting some expected reduction in the growth of depository funding needs associated with the anticipated marked slowing in depository credit expansion over that interval .  the rapid rate of securities acquisitions of late 1997 and earlier this year , which appeared to be related to some large banks ' efforts to increase leverage , is expected to slow .  the pace of lending , too , is likely to remain below that of the first four months of the year as credit demands moderate .  from the fourth quarter through september , m3 is seen as advancing at an 8 - 1/2 percent annual rate , and for the year as a whole at 8 - 1/4 percent , well above the upper bound of its 2 to 6 percent annual range .  directive language"

The Committee was concerned about the inflation outlook at its last meeting, and in some respects that outlook may have worsened. In particular, the unemployment rate may be seen as having now fallen so low that, even if it were to edge up a little, as it does with the slowing of real growth in the staff forecast, the risks of burgeoning inflationary pressures have become unacceptably high. Although the first-quarter ECI increase was less than expected, total compensation, its wage component, and average hourly earnings have all been on an accelerating trend for some time. With the unemployment rate likely to remain far below any plausible estimate of its sustainable level, nominal compensation gains may well continue to mount, in contrast to the staff forecast. If so, expansion of labor compensation would increasingly exceed even optimistic views of a step-up in productivity growth. Moreover, the slowdown in output growth in the staff forecast is by no means a foregone conclusion, absent a tighter monetary policy stance. The effects of Asian woes on net exports may not of themselves be a sufficient offset to buoyant domestic final demand at current levels of short-term interest rates. Although real interest rates are high relative to historical norms, medium- and long- term real rates still may not be elevated enough at present to exert adequate restraint on spending for consumer durables, housing, and business fixed investment in light of optimistic ""animal spirits"" and rising equity prices."

90 period , the committee might want to return to announcing a range based on its projection for this monetary aggregate .  such a range also could be selected for m3 in order to establish a consistent interpretation for all three ranges .  if the committee shifted to projection - based ranges for m2 and m3 for 1998 , substantial adjustments to the ranges that were set in february would be needed to encompass the projected growth of those aggregates , particularly if a cushion between projected growth and the upper bound were thought desirable .  more modest upward adjustments would be needed if the committee shifted to a projection basis for the provisional monetary ranges only for next year , given the staff projection of a deceleration in these aggregates .  the alternative b ranges were constructed to be consistent with the staff forecast for 1999 .  the apparently stronger nominal gdp forecasts of committee members might imply somewhat faster money and debt growth , assuming the committee members ' preliminary forecasts are based on approximately the same paths for interest rates and stock prices as in the staff forecast .  those more rapid growth rates next year would still be below the staff projections for 1998 .  selection of projection - based ranges need not signal that the monetary aggregates are again being given greater consideration in policymaking .  the committee could explain that , even though it believed that velocity behavior had become somewhat more predictable , it nevertheless was simply setting ranges for money and debt consistent with its economic outlook and was not intending to adjust the stance of policy in response to deviations of the aggregates from their ranges .  alternatively , the committee may in fact wish to signal added emphasis on the money and debt aggregates at this time of heightened uncertainties regarding the nairu and other nonmonetary leading indicators of inflation , for such emphasis may help it communicate its concerns about inflation pressures when policy needs to be tightened , particularly if the tightenings have a preemptive quality .  careful explanation could make clear that the added emphasis does not go so far as to imply a presumption that deviations from ranges would trigger policy responses , only that money is one of the many indicators the committee is using .  the choice of the unchanged policy stance of alternative b would seem to follow if the committee found the greenbook forecast both probable and -- despite the projected upcreep in underlying inflation -- acceptable .  the committee might be especially willing to live with an outlook in which the most likely outcome was a modest increase in inflation if it saw the risks around that outcome as unbalanced , with the odds of a considerably larger and persistent rise in inflation less than those of a substantial weakening in activity .  even if underlying inflation tendencies turn out to be a little more intense than anticipated , weakness in commodity and import prices and damped inflation expectations should restrain price increases for a time .  thus , the committee should be able to react sufficiently promptly to any emerging cost pressures in labor markets to limit any incipient increase in inflation and inflation expectations .  on the demand side , an important vulnerability of the staff forecast revolves around developments overseas .  that forecast embodies more stable foreign financial markets and a recovery in the japanese economy starting in the second half of the year .  however , so long as conditions in asian economies and emerging market economies elsewhere stay unsettled and the eventual implementation of effective measures to deal with those conditions remains uncertain , the committee may see a distinct possibility of substantially greater drag on the u.s . economy from the external sector than is in the staff forecast .  moreover , developments abroad may not be wholly immune to monetary policy actions within the united states , and the committee might be willing to delay action for a time , at the risk of a possible pickup in inflation , to avoid further complicating the already unsteady situation in asia and several non - asian emerging market economies .  financial market prices appear to embody the anticipation that monetary policy is on hold for some time , so the choice of the unchanged federal funds rate of alternative b should elicit little response in money , capital , or foreign exchange markets . if the economic data reveal , as under the staff projection , a considerable slowing in spending and muted inflation , intermediate- and longer - term yields could edge lower , while equity prices could falter as corporate profits again prove disappointing .  this downward pressure on yields , however , may be offset somewhat to the extent that the situation in emerging markets does show signs of stabilizing as in the forecast , perhaps unwinding some of the flight -

1/2 percent for real gdp growth , 2 to 2 - 1/2 percent for cpi inflation , and 4 - 1/2 to 4 - 3/4 percent for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of inflation expectations possibly falling further in recent months -- as suggested by a much larger decline in the spread of nominal over indexed treasury yields than can be accounted for by the relative liquidity of these instruments - the real federal funds rate may even have edged higher .  even if the committee 's outlook for spending is stronger than that of the staff , if it has been revised down substantially , a policy ease might still be called for .  moreover , financial markets are fragile and , in the absence of signs of economic recovery and progress on key policy reforms in japan and other countries , the possibilities for disappointing outcomes abroad precipitating further contagion and restraint on spending in the united states may be seen as unacceptably high .  a 25 basis point cut in the funds rate at this point could be viewed as providing a modicum of insurance against the risk of such very adverse outcomes .  in addition to boosting domestic demand , a lower federal funds rate could be of some limited help in relieving pressures on emerging market countries , especially those tied to the dollar or finding themselves in need of defending the exchange value of their currencies through tight monetary policies .  indeed , in recent days as an easing by the federal reserve has come to be seen as more likely , emerging market countries have witnessed some narrowing in spreads on their dollar - denominated debt and some improvement in their stock markets .  if foreign outcomes proved not so disappointing or the domestic economy surprisingly resilient , the policy move could be reversed before long without raising questions about the federal reserve 's anti - inflation resolve .  even if the committee suspected that more easing might eventually be needed , it might want to move by only 25 basis points at this time because of the residual inflation risks inherent in the unusually low unemployment rate along with the strength to date in the economic expansion .  if the committee believed that , as in the staff forecast , a larger policy move were needed to have an adequate effect in forestalling oncoming weakness in economic activity or if it wanted to take more forceful action to address the risks facing financial markets here and abroad , it might choose to reduce the funds rate 50 basis points at this meeting ( alternative a '   .  depending on the wording of the announcement associated with such a move , the market might see the fomc as being on hold for a longer duration , eliminating for a little while market uncertainty about whether additional easings were in the offing .  moves of 50 basis points have been somewhat unusual in recent years , and , in volatile financial markets with largely unanchored expectations , reactions are difficult to gauge .  most likely , equity markets would rally and risk premiums on private debt would fall , as the fomc was seen as taking a more active stance in cushioning the effects of tighter financing conditions and weaker foreign demand on economic activity .  but there is some chance that market participants could interpret the larger move as indicating that the federal reserve viewed the current economic situation as especially serious , perhaps owing to fragility in the financial sector .  if so , the rebound in equities could be tempered while treasury bond prices could be strengthened further .  in any event , the value of the dollar against major currencies would likely drop somewhat under this alternative.4 the prime rate would likely be reduced by 1/2 percentage point .  in the staff forecast , m2 growth would be supported by declines in opportunity costs associated with the policy easings .  5 within the aggregate , growth should be strong in liquid deposits , whose rates adjust relatively sluggishly to declines in market rates , while small time deposits should run off , as offering rates on these deposits tend to adjust faster .  currency demand should remain strong , supported by ongoing turbulence abroad .  money market mutual funds should be buoyed by the declines in market rates and continue to benefit somewhat from 5 the greenbook projection could be considered to be consistent with a 25 basis point easing at this meeting and a similar move toward the end of 1998 .  those assumptions are used for the projections of money growth under alternative a . the reduced attractiveness of stock mutual funds , but to a lesser degree than over the past couple months ; the projected declines in stock prices are not as steep as those that already have occurred , and some of the money fund inflows at the onset of the bear market were likely only parked temporarily while in transit to alternative longer - term investments .  on balance , m2 is projected to grow at a 6 - 1/2 percent rate over the next six months , implying further substantial declines in velocity .  with economic growth softening and bank lending moderating , m3 is projected to decelerate to a 7 - 1/2 percent pace over september to march .  the broad monetary aggregates will almost surely far exceed their growth ranges in 1998 ; m2 is projected to grow 8 percent this year and m3 to grow 10 percent.6 however , a good part of the recent and projected strength in the aggregates apparently reflects shifts in money demand rather than strong spending growth ; m2 has been boosted by heightened demands for liquidity and shifts away from stock market investments , while the elevated growth of m3 has in part reflected a substitution of bank funding sources for market financing by lower - rated business firms .  6 the ranges for 1998 and the preliminary ranges for 1999 are 1 to 5 percent for m2 and 2 to 6 percent for m3 .  directive language"

Nonetheless, the Committee might wish to contemplate the 25 basis point tightening of policy at this meeting under alternative C-- perhaps as background for selection of an asymmetric directive or even for consideration of an intermeeting move once risks associated with the century date change have faded. In the staff forecast, core inflation picks up--and is poised to move higher beyond the projection horizon--even with 75 basis points of further tightening and the more rapid rates of productivity growth that the staff has built into the forecast over recent months. In effect, faster productivity growth, other things equal, needs to be reflected at some point in higher real interest rates to keep the influences of the associated boost to earnings--working on the demands for capital goods and, through wealth, on consumption--from driving aggregate demand further beyond aggregate supply. Still higher interest rates would be needed to bring the levels of demand and supply into balance so as to forestall rising inflation. Indeed, based on incoming spending data and the continued upward march of equity prices, the Committee may see the risks to aggregate demand as having shifted further to the upside over recent months, possibly requiring more restrictive financial conditions than assumed in the staff forecast just to keep the output gap from widening. A firming action at this meeting or in mid-January would be only a little prompter than in the staff forecast. But it is likely to be associated with a sharper rise in market interest rates as market participants inferred from the timing of the action that the Federal Reserve was much more concerned about near-term inflation risks than they had perceived and was on a steeper tightening path than now incorporated in the yield curve. As noted above, a tightening at this meeting would pose some risk of prompting financial market disruptions."
2000/2/1,2000/2/2,b,0,U,5.75,5.5,d,0.25,c,"-23- (29) This bluebook proposes three short-run monetary policy alternatives for the Committee's consideration at this meeting: an unchanged stance of monetary policy (alternative B); a 25 basis point firming of the federal funds rate (alternative C); and a 50 basis point tightening (alternative D). (30) Despite the significant inflation risk embodied in the staff forecast and identified in the Federal Reserve's announcement following the December meeting, the Committee might not yet be convinced that policy action is necessary and hence might be inclined to choose alternative B. Even though labor markets have remained tight for some time, readings on core prices generally have been well behaved, excepting the pickup in various NIPA inflation measures for the fourth quarter reported today. In these circumstances, implementation of the unchanged money market conditions of alternative B, even if accompanied by a statement that the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside, would confuse investors. (36) Under the unchanged money market conditions of alternative B, M2 growth is projected to pick up a bit, to a 6 percent annual rate over the December to June period, from the 5-1/2 percent rate from September to December, despite a small drag from the unwinding of Y2K effects."," if , however , the faster productivity growth of recent years is expected to persist or even pick up further , the ranges in use since the mid-1990s would no longer be centered around money growth expected when prices were stable .  in alternative b , the ranges for m2 and m3 are adjusted upward to allow for faster growth of potential output .  when the committee shifted to using price stability ranges in the mid-1990s , the staffs estimate of potential output growth was about 2 - 1/4 percent and there was thought to be perhaps a percentage point of upward bias in the implicit gdp deflator .  over the last four years , however , the staff estimates that potential gdp growth has averaged about 3 - 1/2 percent , while the bias in the implicit deflator is now about 1/2 percentage point .  potential gdp growth is deduced from estimates of structural productivity growth averaging 2 - 1/2 percent , plus about 1 percent growth in labor  inputs.17,18 the midpoints of the ranges in alternative  ii are consistent with these estimates of recent potential output growth and residual bias in the implicit gdp deflator , assuming historically typical velocity behavior .  with stable velocity , m2 would be expected to grow at the implied 4 percent pace of 17 . while actual nonfarm business productivity has grown at an average 2 - 3/4 percent rate over the last four years , about 1/4 percentage point has been cyclical , according to staff estimates .  differences in the growth rates of output and hours in the nonfarm business sector versus the overall economy require a downward adjustment of 0.1 percentage point in arriving at potential gdp growth .  18 . similar estimates for potential gdp expansion over the last four years can be derived using okun 's law : actual gdp has grown an average 4 - 1/4 percent and the unemployment rate has fallen 0.4 percentage point per annum on balance since 1996 .  estimates of okun 's law over recent decades imply that the difference between actual and potential output growth is twice the rate of decline in the unemployment rate , or 3/4 percentage point , implying potential output growth of 3 - 1/2 percent over the period .  nominal gdp .  the range for m3 would be a percentage point higher than that for m2 , reflecting the faster average growth of the broader aggregate over history .  for a variety of reasons , however , desired steady state growth of the monetary aggregates might be faster than the midpoints of the ranges in alternative b .  the staff estimates that , owing to accelerating productivity , the growth of potential gdp will be yet more elevated going forward--4 percent over this year and next .  moreover , the committee may believe that a small positive true inflation rate is desirable in the long run because of possible nominal rigidities in the economy or because of potential risks to the ability of policy to react forcefully to economic weakness if the nominal federal funds rate were close to the lower bound of zero.20 the committee may view a small positive true inflation rate as still consistent with effective price stability in that such a rate may be sufficiently low as to have no influence on the decision - making of households and businesses .  if the committee did decide to adjust the monetary ranges up by a percentage point or more , the humphrey hawkins report and testimony could clarify that no greater weight was intended to be placed on the aggregates in the formulation of policy .  the july 1999 humphrey  hawkins report noted that such an adjustment might be needed if faster productivity growth persisted .  the velocity of m3 has been rather unstable and its long - run trend difficult to assess ( chart 7 ) .  m3 has grown faster than m2 on average since 1959 ; this divergence has been evident in recent years as well and is projected to continue over the forecast period .  however , it is unclear why nominal magnitudes would grow at divergent rates over the very long run , and the price stability range for m3 might ultimately have to be aligned to that for m2 .  this latter concern may have become less of a risk of late because of apparent increases in the equilibrium real funds rate , likely associated with faster productivity growth .  short - run policy alternatives  despite the significant inflation risk embodied in the staff forecast and identified in the federal reserve 's announcement following the december meeting , the committee might not yet be convinced that policy action is necessary and hence might be inclined to choose alternative b . even though labor markets have remained tight for some time , readings on core prices generally have been well behaved , excepting the pickup in various nipa inflation measures for the fourth quarter reported today .  while these reports may be disquieting , the four - quarter changes in these measures remain moderate .  taken together with other price reports , the recent behavior of core inflation may still be consistent with trend productivity growth that is strong enough , or a natural rate of unemployment that is low enough , to restrain inflation for considerably longer than in the staff forecast .  in light of this possibility , the committee may wish to wait awhile in order better to assess the extent of inflationary pressures .  if the committee were to keep the stance of policy unchanged , however , it presumably would want to accompany announcement of that choice with a statement , under its new policy , that "" the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future , "" given the high rate of labor utilization and the continued strength in demand that could push that rate even higher .  in view of the macroeconomic situation and recent federal reserve statements , market participants uniformly seem to expect a tightening of monetary policy at this meeting , with considerable weight currently being placed on a 25 basis point move and some probability on a 50 basis point increase .  in these circumstances , implementation of the unchanged money market conditions of alternative b , even if accompanied by a statement that the balance of risks remains tilted to the upside , would confuse investors . nonetheless , financial markets , especially for equities , would rally if investors trimmed their expectations of the extent of cumulative monetary tightening .  short - term market interest rates would drop nearly 1/4 percentage point , and the dollar would weaken on foreign exchange markets .  under the unchanged money market conditions of alternative b , m2 growth is projected to pick up a bit , to a 6 percent annual rate over the december to june period , from the 5 - 1/2 percent rate from september to december , despite a small drag from the unwinding of y2k effects .  m2 would be somewhat above its provisional 1 to 5 percent annual range in june .  m3 is expected to decelerate sharply , to a 5 - 1/4 percent rate over the december to june period from the 14 percent pace of september to december .  adjusted for y2k influences , m3 growth is expected to be about the same in the two periods .  m3 also would be above its provisional 2 to 6 percent annual range in june .  growth of the debt of domestic nonfinancial sectors is expected to slow , dropping to a 5 - 1/4 percent rate over the december to june interval from the 6 percent pace between september and december , leaving this aggregate a bit above the middle of its provisional 3 to 7 percent annual range in june .  directive and balance of risks language"

In effect, the Committee would implicitly be making the judgment that the gap between the current real funds rate and its likely equilibrium value provides a sufficient amount of impetus to economic activity over time (see chart and table). Indeed, the Committee may be especially reluctant to ease policy if it thinks the equilibrium real funds rate is likely to rise in the futureâas risk and equity premiums narrow, as is seemingly consistent with recent stock price gains, but also as the thrust of fiscal policy intensifies. With the budget package still working its way through the legislative process, considerable uncertainty surrounds the magnitude of the coming fiscal stimulus. Because this uncertainty should be resolved relatively promptly, the Committee may prefer to keep policy unchanged at this meeting so as to be able to calibrate better its policy action to the size and composition of what becomes law. If the Committee saw easing as a close call, with the federal funds rate as low as 2-1/2 percent, it might be argued that action should be deferred at this meeting so that the Committee would have more scope to respond to potential adverse shocks down the road. As described in the box on the zero bound to nominal interest rates on page 9, this tactic of âsaving your ammunitionâ would follow from the judgment that policy action in a narrow window following an adverse shock would be more effective in bolstering activity over time than lowering rates more aggressively now so that any future shock falls on a stronger economy. Committee inaction at this meeting, even if combined with a statement reaffirming the assessment of predom inant downside risks, would surprise m arket participants. Considerable doubts would be created about whether the federal funds rate would go as low as 1-3/4 p ercent by the early months of next year as m arket participants currently expect. In consequence, other short-term interest rates would move noticeably higher. The likely upward movement of bond yields would be tempered by an immediate selloff of equities. To the extent that the outlook for spending and income turned gloomier, the exchange value of the dollar might fail to appreciate despite the tighter-than-anticipated policy stance.","The Committee might choose to leave the federal funds rate unchanged if it were of the view that action at this meeting would be unlikely to affect the contours of the near-term economic downturn and that past monetary policy easing, probable n ew fiscal measu res, and the natu ral resiliency of private demand should provide enough stimulus to underpin a solid economic recovery before long. In effect, the Committee would implicitly be making the judgment that the gap between the current real funds rate and its likely equilibrium value provides a sufficient amount of impetus to economic activity over time (see chart and table). Indeed, the Committee may be especially reluctant to ease policy if it thinks the equilibrium real funds rate is likely to rise in the futureâas risk and equity premiums narrow, as is seemingly consistent with recent stock price gains, but also as the thrust of fiscal policy intensifies. With the budget package still working its way through the legislative process, considerable uncertainty surrounds the magnitude of the coming fiscal stimulus. Because this uncertainty should be resolved relatively promptly, the Committee may prefer to keep policy unchanged at this meeting so as to be able to calibrate better its policy action to the size and composition of what becomes law. If the Committee saw easing as a close call, with the federal funds rate as low as 2-1/2 percent, it might be argued that action should be deferred at this meeting so that the Committee would have more scope to respond to potential adverse shocks down the road. As described in the box on the zero bound to nominal interest rates on page 9, this tactic of âsaving your ammunitionâ would follow from the judgment that policy action in a narrow window following an adverse shock would be more effective in bolstering activity over time than lowering rates more aggressively now so that any future shock falls on a stronger economy.

adopt a policy stance that is appreciably tighter than financial markets expect, which could further adversely affect household and business sentiment.

The especially adverse outcomes for the economy that the Committee was worried about at the prior few meetings may seem much less likely now. Indeed, in recent weeks, data surprises have nearly all run on the upside, supporting the view that risks are no longer skewed toward economic weakness. Unlike the outlook at the time of the January meeting, the Greenb ook forecast shows less overall slack in resource utilization, little upd rift in the unem ployment rate, and less of a do wntrend to inflation. To be sure, the real funds rate is unsustainably low, and if the nominal
funds rate were held at its current level for very long, inflation would begin to intensify.

The especially adverse outcomes for the economy that the Committee was worried about at the prior few meetings may seem much less likely now. Indeed, in recent weeks, data surprises have nearly all run on the upside, supporting the view that risks are no longer skewed toward economic weakness. Unlike the outlook at the time of the January meeting, the Greenb ook forecast shows less overall slack in resource utilization, little upd rift in the unem ployment rate, and less of a do wntrend to inflation. To be sure, the real funds rate is unsustainably low, and if the nominal
funds rate were held at its current level for very long, inflation would begin to intensify.

While policy action at this meeting is unlikely to leave much of an imprint on economic activity over the balance of this year, the Committee might desire to promote faster economic growth next year than in the Greenbook forecast in order to make more distinct progress in reducing resource slack over time-especially if it believed that inflation would likely remain in a zone near price stability. In that case, the Committee might choose to reduce the federal funds rate 25 basis points. Indeed, as discussed in the box below, the simulation exercise of the FRB/US model dubbed ""perfect foresight"" policy indicates that lowering the funds rate to a bit below 1-1/2 percent would minimize deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural rate and inflation from an  assumed goal that was as low as 1 percent over the extended Greenbook period. That result, of course, depends on a long list of assumptions-including that the staff's assessment of near-term weakness in demand is correct and that the structure of FRB/US is a complete and certain representation of the economy. Alternatively, the Committee might believe that heightened economic uncertainty may restrain household and business spending more than is factored into the Greenbook forecast so as to warrant a quarter-point reduction in the funds rate at this time. Moreover,  the Committee may believe that any additional disinflation could put economic activity and prices uncomfortably close to the point at which the zero nominal bound on short-term interest rates would constrain future policy. Given prevailing market expectations, short-term rates would fall if the Committee were to ease policy at this meeting, but the extent of the drop would depend importantly on the characterization of the balance of risks and the wording of the announcement. If market participants were convinced that the Federal Reserve would ensure that the recovery was not faltering, equity prices would rise and risk spreads fall, while Treasury bond rates would edge higher. However, there is some
chance that market participants might view the easing as implying that the Federal Reserve sees much weaker demand and the economy slipping back into recession. Such an interpretation could put downward pressure on equity prices and bond yields and upward pressure on risk spreads.","In the current Greenbook, the staff has both raised the path expected for the unemployment rate this year and next and lowered its assessment of the degree of labor market slack consistent with unchanged inflation. While policy action at this meeting is unlikely to leave much of an imprint on economic activity over the balance of this year, the Committee might desire to promote faster economic growth next year than in the Greenbook forecast in order to make more distinct progress in reducing resource slack over time-especially if it believed that inflation would likely remain in a zone near price stability. In that case, the Committee might choose to reduce the federal funds rate 25 basis points. Indeed, as discussed in the box below, the simulation exercise of the FRB/US model dubbed ""perfect foresight"" policy indicates that lowering the funds rate to a bit below 1-1/2 percent would minimize deviations of the unemployment rate from its natural rate and inflation from an  assumed goal that was as low as 1 percent over the extended Greenbook period. That result, of course, depends on a long list of assumptions-including that the staff's assessment of near-term weakness in demand is correct and that the structure of FRB/US is a complete and certain representation of the economy. Alternatively, the Committee might believe that heightened economic uncertainty may restrain household and business spending more than is factored into the Greenbook forecast so as to warrant a quarter-point reduction in the funds rate at this time. Moreover,  the Committee may believe that any additional disinflation could put economic activity and prices uncomfortably close to the point at which the zero nominal bound on short-term interest rates would constrain future policy. Given prevailing market expectations, short-term rates would fall if the Committee were to ease policy at this meeting, but the extent of the drop would depend importantly on the characterization of the balance of risks and the wording of the announcement. If market participants were convinced that the Federal Reserve would ensure that the recovery was not faltering, equity prices would rise and risk spreads fall, while Treasury bond rates would edge higher. However, there is some
chance that market participants might view the easing as implying that the Federal Reserve sees much weaker demand and the economy slipping back into recession. Such an interpretation could put downward pressure on equity prices and bond yields and upward pressure on risk spreads."

In such a circumstance, the Committee may see additional stimulus as needed to support overall spending until business confidence can recover. In addition, while the staff has read the continuing weakness in the labor market as signaling higher structural productivity, the Committee may place sizable odds on the view that the same data augur more sluggish economic activity than in the Greenbook forecast.

In fact, futures and options data suggest that market participants do not expect the currently elevated level and uncertainty about oil prices to persist (Chart 6). Moreover, while the nominal price of oil has approached historical highs, the recent spike does not appear outsized in real terms. Even if the Committee is concerned that the pace of economic growth could remain subpar once some of the current uncertainties have been resolved, it still may see a considerable advantage to deferring policy action at this time in order to await more information about geopolitical developments. Indeed, inaction at this meeting might seem especially attractive if the Committee wants to preserve the option of easing forcefully if events turn unexpectedly adverse in coming weeks. Moreover, in the current environment, the response of the economy to policy action at this meeting might be viewed as quite uncertain, and models of optimal monetary policy under uncertainty would counsel gradualism in adjusting policy.","If the Committee remains of the view that the current setting of the federal funds rate likely would provide enough stimulus to redress the existing amount of resource slack over time while maintaining low inflation, it may wish to keep the target rate unchanged.

Indeed, the current setting of the real federal funds rate no longer lies below the lower bound of the range of staff estimates of equilibrium real rates (Chart 7). As a result, members might conclude that a cut in the nominal funds rate would be necessary just to maintain the effective stance of policy established at the November meeting. The Committee might consider a quarter-point policy easing as a measured response to a projected shortfall of economic growth below that of potential this year.  As noted, market prices can be interpreted as incorporating some odds on a policy move at this meeting, but a quarter-point easing is far from fully priced in. As a result, either a quarter-point or half-point easing at this meeting would have a substantial element of surprise.","The Committee might interpret some of the recent data, particularly the February employment report, as pointing to a weaker trend in economic activity than it previously thoughtâand one that might well persist even if global tensions were to diminish markedly in the weeks ahead.

( the staff was surprised as well , and the greenbook forecast of the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 1994 fell about Â¾ percentage point over the course of that year . )  third , uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of future policy actions was high , particularly early in the tightening cycle .  investors reacted to the changed economic and policy outlook by selling long - term securities to limit capital losses and hedge the lengthening durations of mortgage portfolios that resulted from higher interest rates .  these portfolio adjustments at times took place over short periods of time , leading to volatile moves in long - term rates .  as shown in the right panel , long - term yields increased almost as much as short - term rates early in the tightening cycle .  to be sure , the historical record does suggest that changes in the direction of the policy rate tend to elicit a stronger market response than actions extending the existing trend in the policy rate .  and the turbulence in financial markets last summer and fall may suggest that hedging flows will magnify the amplitude of any swings in longer - term interest rates .  as a result , some firms with large interest rate exposures could face substantial losses when interest rates rise .  that said , there are some signs that financial firms and markets may be able to handle policy tightening better than they did in 1994 .  although the expected policy path is not as steep now as the actual tightening that took place ten years ago , it is nonetheless considerably steeper than that foreseen immediately before the first tightening in 1994 .  even if interest rates do respond strongly to a move toward tighter policy , financial institutions appear better positioned to withstand the impact owing to improved risk - management practices .  and , although the size of the mortgage market is now much larger , the recent run - up in interest rates has reduced prepayment rates enough to moderate the extent to which any further increase in rates will induce hedging flows .  lessons from the 1994 - 95 tightening cycle ( continued )"

than - usual uncertainty surrounds the outlook for the economy as spending moves out of its recent soft patch .  if the committee put much weight on the possibility that growth will rebound sharply , it may believe that the scope of its future action is constrained on the upside by the â measured pace â language and may prefer to drop the last two sentences from the statement , as is considered in alternative c .  monetary policy has been highly accommodative for an extended period , and as noted , the real federal funds rate is currently about zero and may well be considerably below its equilibrium level .  indeed , given the decline in longer - term yields and increases in equity prices , financial conditions likely eased further over the intermeeting period .  policymakers may be concerned that this monetary stimulus could be stoking a buildup of overall inflationary pressures or fostering misalignments of asset prices .  as to the former , if the prospects for aggregate supply were described not by the greenbook baseline but by the â less room to grow â alternative simulation ( in which the nairu is higher and the labor force participation rate does not rise any further to augment labor inputs ) , then the committee might envision more forceful action sometime soon .  as to the latter concern about asset prices , some could view the rapid rise in home values , which presumably is being fed in part by the low level of real interest rates , as a possible manifestation of misallocation of resources and a potential threat to financial stability ( see box ) .  removing the â measured pace â language would capture market attention and result in a tightening of financial market conditions that would provide some restraint on asset prices and inflation .  housing prices and monetary policy over the last several years , real home prices in the united states have increased sharply ( left panel ) .  moreover , house prices have risen well above gains in rents , indicating either an expectation of future significant increases in rents , a lowered risk premium , or a decline in the risk - free rate of discount .  in any case , and as shown in the right panel , the price - rent ratio has moved well above its typical range , potentially raising some of the same challenges for monetary policy posed by the stock market boom in the late 1990s .  with the value of homes accounting for about a quarter of household assets , changes in their prices could well have an appreciable effect on spending .  in addition , a significant misalignment of housing prices could prompt resource misallocations .  housing prices , however , are much less volatile than equity prices , suggesting that these developments would tend to unfold slowly , if at all .  such concerns have led some observers to argue that the fomc take more explicit account of perceived deviations of house prices from fundamentals in formulating monetary policy .  in particular , advocates of such an approach generally argue that it may be desirable to tighten more aggressively at present than would otherwise be the case so as to contain or even reverse the perceived asset price misalignment and thereby avoid an especially sharp and painful asset price correction at some future date .  an alternative view is that monetary policy should respond to perceived asset price misalignments only to the extent that they contain information about the outlook for inflation and output .  moreover , the available empirical evidence demonstrates only that asset ( house ) prices are high compared with predicted values from models based on historical behavior .  models , however , are imperfect , and consequently it remains a judgment call whether this deviation really represents a departure from fundamentals or is a manifestation of changed fundamentals not fully accounted for by the model .  even if house prices were known with certainty to be overvalued , the appropriate policy response is not obvious .  more aggressive policy tightening might reduce the demand for real estate and gradually bring home prices in line with fundamentals , although the appropriate degree of tightening would be difficult to calibrate .  if the misalignment , however , were viewed as likely to correct itself in short order , it might well be appropriate to ease policy ( or tighten less aggressively ) to cushion the expected fall in demand .  given such uncertainties , the standard prescription is that monetary policy should be driven primarily by economic fundamentalsâ  the outlook for output and inflation  even when home prices or other asset prices may not be .  adoption of alternative c would surprise market participants and , given the precedent of the marked reaction when the â considerable period â sentence was modified in january , could prompt significant swings in financial prices .  the path expected for the funds rate would rotate up , and market participants probably would become somewhat more chary about risk -

term inflation expectations could move higher were the committee not seen as responding sufficiently to inflationary impulses emanating from the decline in the dollar and the previous rise in oil prices .  the statement in alternative c could be quite similar to that released following the november meeting .  in light of the relatively soft employment report for november , however , the announcement could indicate that labor market conditions â continue to improve gradually . â   also , in view of the significant decline in oil prices in recent weeks , the clause on output could be revised to refer to the â earlier â rise in energy prices .  the general similarity of the language to that employed in november and the continued characterization of the policy stance as â accommodative â would avoid the suggestion that the committee believes a pause in policy tightening is likely in the near term .  as drafted , the statement retains a balanced assessment of risks to sustainable growth and price stability â an assessment that some members might see as conditioned on an appropriate path for policy going forward â as well as new estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate this bluebook introduces new estimates of the equilibrium real federal funds rate .  the new estimates were developed to address shortcomings of the earlier measures that , as reported in the bluebook readership survey , made them difficult to interpret.1 one problem with the earlier measures was that the concept underlying the measures was not defined clearly .  for example , the time horizon â the period over which the output gap would be projected to close if the real funds rate were kept at its equilibrium level â differed across measures and was not clearly specified .  second , the chart summarizing the various measures may have given a misleading picture of the uncertainty surrounding the point estimates .  finally , the two - sided estimates that were included would seem to be inappropriate for real - time policymaking .  the new chart reports two kinds of equilibrium rate measures , differing in terms of their time horizon .  the short - run equilibrium rate is defined to be the rate that , if sustained , would be projected to close the output gap in twelve quarters .  the medium - run measure is defined to be the rate projected to prevail in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy will act to eliminate economic slack in three years and to hold output at potential thereafter .  the new estimates are calculated based on three different models : a single - equation model of the output gap , a small structural model consisting of equations for five key macroeconomic variables , and the staff âs large - scale model ( frb / us ) .  in addition to the range encompassing the point estimates of the three models , the chart also displays confidence bands that illustrate the uncertainties surrounding the range of model estimates .  also shown are the greenbook - consistent measure of the short - run equilibrium rate â which is based on a version of the frb / us model that has been adjusted to match the greenbook forecast â and the medium - run equilibrium rate consistent with tips yields .  the new model - based estimates shown in this bluebook suggest a higher current level for the equilibrium real federal funds rate than did the range based on the old methods that was included in the november bluebook .  this difference occurs mainly because we have dropped the measures based on the statistical - filter model , which exhibited implausibly large responses to surprises in output .  the greenbook- consistent measure currently yields an equilibrium rate lower than model - based estimates because the greenbook projects that the recent weakness in aggregate demand will diminish more gradually than the models predict .  it should be noted that the appropriate stance of policy relative to the equilibrium estimates in a given instance will depend on policymakers â objectives and the projected paths for output and inflation .  thus , these estimates of the equilibrium rate should not be interpreted as policy prescriptions , but rather as potential inputs to the policy process .  the new estimates are shown in chart 5 .  the chart is accompanied by a brief set of explanatory notes ; further details are provided in flint brayton and david reifschneider , â revised bluebook estimates of the equilibrium real rate â overview , â and â revised bluebook estimates of the equilibrium real rate â technical documentation , â memorandums to the fomc , december 7 , 2004 .  chart 5 equilibrium real federal funds rate percent 25 b.p .  tightening current rate notes : the real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the quarterly average of the actual nominal funds rate and the log difference of the core pce price index over the previous four quarters .  for the current quarter , the nominal funds rate used is the target federal funds rate as of the close of the bluebook .  notes : the figures in the "" previous bluebook "" column indicate the estimates for the current quarter as of the previous bluebook that would have been reported using the new procedures .  confidence intervals and bands reflect uncertainties about model specification , coefficients , and the level of potential output .  short -

run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would be anticipated to close the output gap in twelve quarters , and the medium - run concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them equal thereafter .  with the exception of the tips - consistent measure , the real federal funds rates employ the log difference of the core pce price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation , with the staff projection used for the current quarter .  tips indexation is based on the total cpi .  measure description single - equation model  the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .  in light of this model âs simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .  small structural model the small -

by that index , the real funds rate would be less than Â¼ percentage point below its estimated equilibrium value after implementation of this alternative .  in addition , a 3 percent nominal federal funds rate would sit high in the range of policy recommendations from simple policy rules provided in chart 6âand especially so if members viewed 2 percent inflation in the core pce index as an acceptable outcome .  a gloomy view of the risks to the outlook for spending would presumably also incline the committee to signal a pause .  for instance , economic activity could be weaker in coming quarters than in the staff forecast for the reasons explored in the â sentiment slump â and â sentiment slump with financial spillover â scenarios in the greenbook .  as another possibility , members may be of the view that the slowing in spending and activity of late owes less to elevated energy prices and more to the cumulative monetary policy restraint put in place since june of last year than is implicit in the greenbook .  5    pausing to assess the effects already in the pipeline from cumulative 5 while most longer - term yields remain below their levels just before tightening commenced ,  short- and intermediate - term yields are now much higher .  those latter increases may be crimping spending more than the staff has allowed for , either because the economy is now more sensitive to class  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 19 of 40 chart 6 actual and assumed  federal funds rate and range of values from policy rules and futures markets percent shaded region is the range of values from rules  1a , 2a , 4 , 5 , and 6 below actual federal funds rate and greenbook assumption market expectations estimated from futures quotes values of the federal funds rate from policy rules and futures markets  q1 rules with imposed coefficients rules with estimated coefficients  memo note : rule prescriptions for 2005q2 through 2006q1 are calculated using current greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap ( or unemployment gap ) .   for rules that contain the lagged funds rate , the rule âs previous prescription for the funds rate is used to compute prescriptions for 2005q3 through 2006q1 .  it is assumed that there is no feedback from the rule prescriptions to the greenbook projections through 2006q1 .  the tips - based rule is computed using average tips and nominal treasury yields to date .  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 20 of 40 policy rules  chart : explanatory notes in all of the rules below , it denotes the federal funds rate , Ït the staff estimate at date t of trailing four- quarter core pce inflation , ( yt - yt  the staff estimate ( at date t ) of the output gap ,  Ï * policymakers â long- run objective for inflation , it-1 the lagged federal funds rate , gt-1   the residual from the rule âs prescription the previous quarter , ( yt+3|t  -yt+3|t * )  the staff âs three - quarter - ahead forecast of the output gap , (  â yt+3|t- âyt+3|t * )  the staff âs forecast of output growth less potential output growth three quarters ahead , Ït+3|t a three - quarter - ahead forecast of inflation , and ( ut+3|t  -ut+3|t * ) a three - quarter - ahead forecast of the unemployment gap .  data are quarterly averages taken from the greenbook and staff memoranda closest to the middle of each quarter , unless otherwise noted .  root - mean- square error rule specification 1988:1-  2005:1 2001:1- 2005:1 rules with imposed coefficients 1 .  baseline taylor rule it  0.5(Ït - Ï  .97 a 1.08a 2 .  aggressive taylor rule it  + ( yt - yt  0.5(Ït - Ï * )  first - difference rule it =  yt+3|t-â yt+3|t  + 0.5(Ït+3|t - Ï * ) .97a  rules with estimated coefficients 4 .  estimated outcome - based rule rule includes both lagged interest rate and serial correlation in residual .  + 0.48 [ 1.23  0.96(yt - yt * ) + 1.47Ït]+ 0.51gt-1 5 .  estimated greenbook forecast - based rule rule includes both lagged interest rate and serial correlation in residual .  + 0.29 [ 0.66 + 1.05(yt+3|t  -yt+3|t * )  + 1.61Ït+3|t ]  estimated fomc forecast - based rule unemployment and inflation forecasts are from semiannual â central tendency â of fomc forecasts , interpolated if necessary to yield 3- qtr - ahead values ;

run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given  a model âs projection of the economy , and the medium - run concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them equal thereafter .  the real federal funds rate employs the log difference of the core pce price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation , with the staff projection used for the current quarter .  since tips indexation is based on the total cpi , the tips - consistent measure incorporates an adjustment for the expected difference between cpi inflation and core pce inflation .  measure description single - equation model  the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .  in light of this model âs simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .  small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .  unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .  large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using  frb / usâ  the staff âs  large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy â depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model âs exogenous variables .  these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .  thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .  greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .  rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .  frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,  and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .  the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .  tips - consistent yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) incorporate investors â expectations of the future path of real interest rates .  the seven - year instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date reflects the short - term real interest rate expected to prevail in seven years .  this forward rate is adjusted down for a term premium , assumed to be 70 basis points , and adjusted up for the difference between total cpi inflation and core pce inflation , projected to be 40 basis points in the medium run .  i fomc -

up pace of firming or of a pause .   assuming that those differing interpretations about offset each other , there is little reason to suspect that the market reaction to the adoption of alternative b would be significant ."

( the characterization that policy is accommodative elsewhere in the statement would remain as the sole signal of the direction of future action . )  even after these deletions , the committee might wish to underscore that its future actions would depend on evolving economic outcomes by indicating , with a nod to its dual objectives , that â the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to fulfill its obligation to foster the attainment of both sustainable economic growth and price stability .  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 24 of 40  the selection of the 50-basis - point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative c would come as a considerable surprise to market participants .  that hike , coupled with some or all of the changes in announcement wording discussed in the previous paragraph , would prompt investors to revise sharply upward their expectations for the path of monetary policy in the near term and likely beyond , and thus would have a pronounced effect on financial markets more generally .  interest rates would rise substantially across the yield curve , equity prices would probably decline , and the foreign exchange value of the dollar could increase significantly .  the same language associated with a quarter - point increase in the funds rate would also send markets in the same direction , but to a lesser extent . money and debt forecasts"

run equilibrium value .  even with such an assessment , though , members may judge that continuing to tighten policy at a measured pace , albeit over a slightly longer period than previously anticipated , should provide adequate restraint on spending and inflation .  as shown in table 1 , the statement for alternative b updates the wording employed in june in light of incoming data on spending , output , and employment by noting that â aggregate spending , despite high energy prices , appears to have strengthened since late winter , and labor market conditions continue to improve gradually.â5   the committee might acknowledge incoming price data by noting that â core inflation has been relatively low in recent months , â and , with both survey and tips -

run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given  a model âs projection of the economy , and the medium - run concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them equal thereafter .  the real federal funds rate employs the log difference of the core pce price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation , with the staff projection used for the current quarter .  since tips indexation is based on the total cpi , the tips - consistent measure incorporates an adjustment for the expected difference between cpi inflation and core pce inflation .  measure description single - equation model  the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .  in light of this model âs simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .  small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .  unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .  large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using  frb / usâ  the staff âs  large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy â depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model âs exogenous variables .  these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .  thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .  greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .  rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .  frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,  and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .  the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .  tips - consistent yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) incorporate investors â expectations of the future path of real interest rates .  the seven - year instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date reflects the short - term real interest rate expected to prevail in seven years .  this forward rate is adjusted down for a term premium , assumed to be 70 basis points , and adjusted up for the difference between total cpi inflation and core pce inflation , projected to be 40 basis points in the medium run .  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 14 of 35 assessment would also support retention of the phrase indicating that the removal of policy accommodation can likely proceed at a measured pace .  investors appear virtually certain that the fomc will increase the target federal funds rate 25 basis points at this meeting , and they reportedly put high odds on an announcement that retains both the measured pace language and the assessment that the risks to sustainable growth and to price stability should remain balanced with appropriate policy action .  thus , the market reaction to an announcement along the lines of alternative b should be relatively modest , although rates could back up a little in response to the changes in the wording suggesting that the fomc was focusing on the strength in spending and inflation pressures .  barring significant downside surprises in economic data over coming weeks , investors would likely come to boost further the already substantial odds placed on additional policy moves later this year , particularly should public statements by policymakers point to a continuation of firming ."

looking language .  if the committee has become significantly more concerned about inflation pressures of late , it may favor the 50-basis - point increase in the federal funds rate of alternative c .  greater worries about inflation prospects could have been prompted by the brisk growth in aggregate demand apparently in train in the current quarter , which could be read as suggesting that asset prices are not exerting sufficient restraint on spending to keep actual output from overshooting its potential before long .  moreover , members may see the potential for an intensification of cost pressures stemming from a variety of sources .  the further rise in far - dated oil futures prices over the intermeeting period , for example , suggests that business energy costs will ratchet up somewhat further in coming months .  also , members may be concerned about the potential for further acceleration in unit labor costs if their assessment of the nairu is noticeably higher than the staff âs estimate of 5 percent or if they judge that structural productivity growth could be slowing more sharply than estimated by the staff .  indeed , the slower growth of productivity in recent quarters as well as the lower estimates of productivity implied by the annual revisions to the national income and product accounts might incline policymakers to trim their views of structural productivity even more than has the staff .  and , even if they had a baseline outlook for the economy and prices similar to that in the greenbook forecast , members may prefer lower inflation than the 2 percent core pce rate projected by the staff for late  the committee could consider a number of modifications to its statement in conjunction with the selection of alternative c .   for instance , the fomc might wish to delete the reference to â robust underlying growth in productivity . â  although the staff continues to forecast solid growth of structural productivity , the committee âs confidence on this score may be diminishing and hence it might not wish to class i fomc -

looking language from the statement , dropping both the risk assessment and the last two sentences referring to the measured pace of tightening and to the committee  âs commitment to respond to economic developments as needed to maintain price stability .  market participants would no doubt be taken aback by the combination of a 50-basis - point increase in the funds rate at this meeting and the announcement suggested for alternative c .  investors might infer that policy firming in the current cycle would likely bring the funds rate appreciably above 4Â¼ percent , the peak funds rate that seems to be currently incorporated in market prices .  moreover , with the elimination of the measured - pace language , market participants might come to believe that at least some of that rate gap could be covered in additional 50-basis - point strides .  with the expected policy path pushed sharply upward and little forward- looking guidance provided by the fomc , investors â uncertainty regarding the future path of policy would likely increase .  in all likelihood , the upward revision to policy expectations would trigger a sell - off in fixed - income and equity markets and a rise in the foreign - exchange value of the dollar , although the increase in long - term yields and appreciation of the dollar could be limited if the drop in share prices were especially sharp .  if the fomc were particularly concerned about inflation pressures but was not prepared to hike rates 50 basis points at this meeting , it could couple a quarter- point move with some of the changes in the statement  suggested for alternative c . class  i fomc -

Under Alternative B, the form of the assessment of risks would be modified notably, with the Committee indicating explicitly a judgment that some further tightening would be necessary to keep the risks to both sustainable economic growth and price stability roughly in balance. However, the rationale section of Alternative C would convey greater concerns about inflation than the comparable portion of Alternative B. Alternative B (11) The Committee may favor the statement language of Alternative B if it thinks that somewhat higher federal funds rates are likely to prove necessary to limit pressures on resources and promote price stability but also believes that this tightening phase could be ending fairly soon.

Given the extent of the changes proposed for Alternative B, it is difficult to be confident of how the new statement will be interpreted by investors. _x001A_ The reference to the relatively high levels of resource utilization, in contrast to the concerns about possible increases in resource utilization expressed in Alternative B, would indicate greater concern about pressures on inflation arising from this source and might suggest that monetary policy now would be oriented particularly toward slowing growth in aggregate demand to a pace at or below that of potential output."," the committee might believe that a 25 basis point firming of policy at this meeting is appropriate for a number of reasons .  in the staff forecast , output remains near potential , and core inflation , though boosted for a time by the indirect effects of higher energy prices , ends the projection period near 1Â¾ percent â a level that many members may see as compatible with their price stability objective .  if the committee believes the greenbook forecast is plausible and acceptable , then it would probably find the 25 basis point policy firming at this meeting assumed in that projection to be attractive .  put a bit differently , the committee may see the current constellation of class  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 14 of 42 asset prices and interest rates in financial markets as likely to be consistent with output running near potential and inflation  remaining contained .  if so , then it might want to ratify market expectations of a further 25 basis point tightening at this meeting .  of course , should the committee âs outlook have changed significantly since the november meeting , it might wish to select a different setting for its policy instrument than assumed in the alternatives discussed below .  the committee may favor the statement language of alternative b if it thinks that somewhat higher federal funds rates are likely to prove necessary to limit pressures on resources and promote price stability but also believes that this tightening phase could be ending fairly soon .  the resilience of the economy in the face of hurricane - related disruptions , already limited margins of slack in resource markets , and the pressures on inflation from elevated energy prices may incline the committee to believe that additional firming will probably be necessary even after a 25 basis point move at this meeting .  but the committee may be of the view that , with policy accommodation now significantly reduced ,  the appropriate timing and extent of additional policy firming are becoming more uncertain .  declines in energy prices and inflation expectations from their recent peaks may have eased members â concerns about the inflation outlook .  and the real federal funds rate ( as measured using lagged inflation to proxy for inflation expectations ) is now within the range of staff estimates of its equilibrium value ( chart 5 ) .  moreover , with a 25 basis point tightening at this meeting , the federal funds rate would be above the range of prescriptions from policy rules based on a target for inflation of 1Â½ percent ( chart 6 ) , and one more tightening would bring the rate to the top of the range that the rules would call for even in the second half of next year .  i fomc -

run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model âs projection of the economy .  for the first two measures , the medium - run concept is the value of the real funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keep them equal thereafter .  the tips - based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead .  the actual real federal funds rate shown in the chart employs the log difference of the core pce price index over the previous four quarters as a proxy for expected inflation , with the staff projection used for the current quarter .  measure description single - equation model  the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .  in light of this model âs simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .  small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .  unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .  large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using  frb / usâ  the staff âs  large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy â depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model âs exogenous variables .  these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .  thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .  greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .  rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .  frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,  and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .  the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .  tips - based factor model yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) reflect investors â expectations of the future path of real interest rates , but also include term and liquidity premiums .  the tips - based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven - year - ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date .  this forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three - factor arbitrage - free term - structure model applied to tips yields , nominal yields , and inflation .  because tips indexation is based on the total cpi , this measure is also adjusted for the medium - term difference â projected at 40 basis points  âbetween total cpi inflation and core pce inflation .  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 17 of 42 chart 6 actual and assumed  federal funds rate and range of values from policy rules and futures markets percent shaded region is the range of values from rules  1a , 2a , 4 , 5 , and 6 below actual federal funds rate and greenbook assumption market expectations estimated from futures quotes values of the federal funds rate from policy rules and futures markets q3 q4  q3 rules with imposed coefficients rules with estimated coefficients memo note : rule prescriptions for 2005q4 through 2006q3 are calculated using current greenbook projections for inflation and the output gap ( or unemployment gap ) .   for rules that contain the lagged funds rate , the rule âs previous prescription for the funds rate is used to compute prescriptions for 2006q2 and 2006q3 .  it is assumed that there is no feedback from the rule prescriptions to the greenbook projections through 2006q3 .  the tips -

term inflation expectations remain contained .  however , given the apparent underlying strength of aggregate demand , members may want to note that â possible increases in resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures .  the assessment of risks portion of the statement for alternative b resolves some of the complications and tensions that have arisen in the current language .  it starts by removing the arguably tautological statement that â appropriate policy â should keep the risks to sustainable growth and price stability balanced , and it also drops the indication that â policy accommodation can be removed at a pace that is likely to be measured . â  instead , the assessment notes that â some further measured policy firming is likely to be needed to keep the risks to both price stability and sustainable economic growth roughly in balance . â  the committee may find this formulation attractive because it simplifies the existing wording considerably but does not greatly change its message regarding the likely near - term path for policy .  if the committee continues to expect that policy will be adjusted gradually , almost surely in increments of 25 basis points , then the retention of the word â measured â would seem appropriate .  and the use of the word â  some â would suggest that the committee expects that the necessary amount of additional tightening is not large .  given the class i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 20 of 42 considerable uncertainty about the level of the equilibrium federal funds rate , members may no longer be confident that policy is accommodative , and so welcome the deletion of the reference to the removal of policy accommodation here as well as in the rationale section .  this deletion might seem even more appropriate if members see a possibility that the federal funds rate will need to be raised above its equilibrium value in order to keep inflation contained .  as in recent announcements , the committee might want to emphasize that policy actions will depend on evolving economic conditions .  along these lines , the last sentence in the statement notes that â the committee will respond to changes in economic prospects as needed to maintain price stability and foster sustainable economic growth . -- given the extent of the changes proposed for alternative b , it is difficult to be confident of how the new statement will be interpreted by investors .  if the committee takes this view , then it might be inclined to retain some of the statement language used at its last meeting .  such a statement could start by indicating that the economic expansion remains vigorous .  given the strength seen in underlying aggregate demand and the possible upward pressures on inflation , the statement might continue to characterize the stance of policy as accommodative .  the inflation discussion could note that â relatively high levels of resource utilization as well as elevated energy prices have the potential to add to inflation pressures . â   the reference to the relatively high levels of resource utilization , in contrast to the concerns about possible increases in resource utilization expressed in alternative b , would indicate greater concern about pressures on inflation arising from this source and might suggest that monetary policy now would be oriented particularly toward slowing growth in aggregate demand to a pace at or below that of potential output .  the assessment of risks portion of the statement could again indicate that , with â appropriate policy , â the risks to both of the committee âs dual objectives should be kept roughly balanced and that policy accommodation can be removed at a measured pace ."

run scenarios discussed earlier .  to achieve a 1Â½ percent objective for core pce inflation , model - based optimal policy paths , along with several policy rules shown in charts 8 and 9 , point to a need to raise the funds rate above 4Â½ percent fairly soon.8   even if a target funds rate above 4Â½ percent needs to be reversed before too long , it might be required to offset near- term pressures on inflation .  in addition , the moderation in spending growth in the staff forecast depends in part on some cooling of house price appreciation , which is not yet a foregone conclusion , and projecting a more restrictive stance of policy may be appropriate until such a trend is better established .  8 chart 8 presents two new estimated rules , along with confidence bands reflecting uncertainty about the policy path obtained from model - based simulations of future economic shocks and on options quotes , as discussed in the box .  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 22 of 42 new analysis of monetary policy rules  this bluebook introduces two new exhibits related to policy rules .  first , chart 8 depicts the implications of estimated policy rules , together with information from futures and options prices .  in the top left panel , the dashed line denotes the path implied by a rule that relates the federal funds rate to its own lagged values , to the current four - quarter average core pce inflation rate , and to the current and lagged output gap ( known as an outcome - based rule because it relies on observed macroeconomic variables ) .  this empirical specification was chosen using a formal statistical procedure that balances simplicity of the specification with goodness - of - fit over the sample period 1988q1 through 2005q4 .  dynamic simulation of the frb / us model was then used to determine the predicted funds rate path that this rule implies over the greenbook horizon.1 the chart also depicts the range of uncertainty for the outcome - based rule associated with the incidence of shocks that might occur over the forecast period .  for that purpose , stochastic simulations of the frb / us model were performed using the estimated distribution of shocks over the post-1987 period to every equation of the model , except the policy rule .  the dark green region shows the 70 percent confidence interval while the light green region denotes the 90 percent confidence interval .  the dotted line in the left panel portrays the path prescribed by a forecast - based rule , estimated using greenbook forecasts for the two - quarter - ahead four - quarter - average core pce inflation rate and the one - quarter - ahead and one - quarter lag of the output gap , along with two lags of the funds rate .  this specification was chosen by a procedure similar to that for the outcome - based rule .  relative to the outcome - based rule , this rule prescribes a path that is tighter by about Â¼ percentage point during 2006 and easier by a similar amount during 2007.2 the right panel of chart 8 provides information from futures and options markets .  expectations for the federal funds rate derived from quotes on federal funds and eurodollar futures are shown as a dotted line in the right panel .  the expected funds rate has a mild humped shape over the next two years .  the confidence bands reflect uncertainty as computed from options prices .  note that financial markets have built in somewhat less uncertainty than is suggested by the stochastic simulations of the outcome - based rule .  finally , chart 9 reports on prescriptions from simple policy rules that have been included in bluebooks since january 2004 .   using dynamic simulations of the frb / us model , these rule prescriptions are now shown for the entire greenbook horizon .  with an inflation objective of 1Â½ percent , the baseline and aggressive taylor rules prescribe funds rate paths that are lower than the greenbook assumption , whereas the first - difference rule implies a markedly tighter path during 2007 .  1 further explanatory notes are given on the page following these charts .  2 confidence intervals for this rule are not available .  i fomc -

run equilibrium rate is defined as the rate that would close the output gap in twelve quarters given the corresponding model âs projection of the economy .  for the first two measures , the medium - run concept is the value of the real federal funds rate projected to keep output at potential in seven years under the assumption that monetary policy acts to bring actual and potential output into line in the short run and then keeps them equal thereafter .  the tips - based factor model measure provides an estimate of market expectations for the real federal funds rate seven years ahead .  the actual real federal funds rate is constructed as the difference between the nominal rate and realized inflation , where the nominal rate is measured as the quarterly average of the observed federal funds rate , and realized inflation is given by the log difference between the staff âs estimate of the core pce price index and its lagged value four quarters earlier .  for the current quarter , the nominal rate is specified as the target federal funds rate on the bluebook publication date .  measure description single - equation model  the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .  in light of this model âs simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .  small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .  unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .  large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using  frb / usâ  the staff âs  large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy â depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model âs exogenous variables .  these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .  thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .  greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .  rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .  frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,  and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .  the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .  tips - based factor model yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) reflect investors â expectations of the future path of real interest rates , but also include term and liquidity premiums .  the tips - based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven - year - ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date .  this forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three - factor arbitrage - free term - structure model applied to tips yields , nominal yields , and inflation .  because tips indexation is based on the total cpi , this measure is also adjusted for the medium -

( see the box â intercept shifts in empirical taylor rules . â )   a pause at this meeting , after seventeen consecutive actions , might be seen as desirable in order to limit the risk of over - tightening and the adverse consequences for employment and growth .  with the real federal funds rate in the range of model - based estimates of its equilibrium value ( chart 8) , the risk that deferring action for a brief time might significantly worsen underlying inflationary trends would seem to be modest .  nonetheless , the committee may feel that elevated energy   and commodity prices , possible further increases in these prices , and high levels of resource utilization imply that the upside risks to inflation remain substantial and perceive only limited downside risks to the economic expansion , and so see intercept shifts in empirical policy rules  chart 5 shows the projections of two empirical policy rules â specified in terms of either outcomes or forecasts of the output gap and core inflation â that have been estimated using quarterly data from 1988q1 to 2005q4 .  in previous bluebooks , both of these rules involved a time - invariant intercept , essentially implying that the medium - run equilibrium real rate ( r * ) and the implicit inflation objective ( Ï * ) remained constant throughout the sample period .  however , recent staff analysis indicates that a significant upward shift in the intercept of each empirical rule occurred in the late 1990s .  such a shift could arise from either a 75 basis point rise in r * , a 1 percentage point decline in Ï * , or some combination of the two .  the funds rate projections and confidence intervals shown in chart 5 incorporate these intercept shifts .  the projections generated by the forecast - based rule are broadly similar to the expectations of market participants , while the outcome - based rule points to some additional firming .  reflecting the possibility of an upward shift in the value of r  * , this bluebook introduces an additional simple policy rule in chart 6 .  for each specified value of Ï  ( either 1Â½ or 2 percent ) , the new rule follows taylor ( 1999 ) with respect to the policy coefficients â which determine the responsiveness of the funds rate to movements in the output gap and core inflation â but specifies the value of r at 2.75 percent instead of 2 percent .  i fomc -

equation model  the measure of the equilibrium real rate in the single - equation model is based on an estimated aggregate - demand relationship between the current value of the output gap and its lagged values as well as the lagged values of the real federal funds rate .  in light of this model âs simple structure , the short - run measure of the equilibrium real rate depends only on the recent position of output relative to potential , and the medium - run measure is virtually constant .  small structural model the small - scale model of the economy consists of equations for five variables : the output gap , the equity premium , the federal budget surplus , the trend growth rate of output , and the real bond yield .  unlike the estimates from the single - equation model , values of the equilibrium real rate also depend directly on conditions associated with output growth , fiscal policy , and capital markets .  large model ( frb / us ) estimates of the equilibrium real rate using  frb / usâ  the staff âs  large - scale econometric model of the u.s . economy â depend on a very broad array of economic factors , some of which take the form of projected values of the model âs exogenous variables .  these projections make use of several simple forecasting rules which are appropriate for the three - year horizon relevant for the short - run concept but are less sensible over longer horizons .  thus , we report only the short - run measure for the frb / us model .  greenbook- consistent measures of the equilibrium real rate can not be directly obtained from the greenbook forecast , because the greenbook is not based on a formal model .  rather , we use the frb / us model in conjunction with an extended version of the greenbook forecast to derive a greenbook - consistent measure .  frb / us is first add - factored so that its simulation matches the extended greenbook forecast ,  and then a second simulation is run off this baseline to determine the value of the real federal funds rate that closes the output gap .  the medium - run concept of the equilibrium real rate is not computed because it requires a relatively long extension of the greenbook forecast .  tips - based factor model yields on tips ( treasury inflation - protected securities ) reflect investors â expectations of the future path of real interest rates , but also include term and liquidity premiums .  the tips - based measure of the equilibrium real rate is constructed using the seven - year - ahead instantaneous real forward rate derived from tips yields as of the bluebook publication date .  this forward rate is adjusted to remove estimates of the term and liquidity premiums based on a three - factor arbitrage - free term - structure model applied to tips yields , nominal yields , and inflation .  because tips indexation is based on the total cpi , this measure is also adjusted for the medium -

third chance of a policy firming at this meeting and appear to anticipate a statement similar to that under alternative b .   as a result , the market reaction to implementation of this alternative would likely be fairly small .  while short -

based rule ( dotted lines ) , in which policy responds to contemporaneous four - quarter average core inflation and to contemporaneous and lagged output gaps .  all three policy paths generate fairly similar trajectories for inflation , reflecting the relatively sluggish inflation dynamics in the frb / us model .  deviations from baseline ( in percentage points ) optimal policy with perfect foresight optimal policy with gradual learning empirical outcome -

If the Committee judges that the downside risks to growth and the upside risks to inflation are now roughly balanced, it might wish to leave the stance of policy unchanged at this meeting but release a statement that combines the Alternative A language on real activity (A.2) with the Alternative B language on inflation (B.3) and the balanced risk assessment of Alternative A (A.4)_x001A_of course, it would be necessary to drop the phrase, _x001A_After this action."," if the committee continues to view the current stance of policy as likely to foster sustainable growth and an acceptable trajectory for inflation , then it may wish to choose alternative b , under which its target for the federal funds rate would remain at 5Â¼ percent for the time being .  the real federal funds rate is close to its greenbook - consistent equilibrium value ( chart 5 ) , supporting a view that the current stance of policy is likely to promote a gradual easing of pressures on resources .  additionally , the current target for the funds rate remains close to prescriptions for near - term policy obtained from optimal policy simulations with a 2 percent inflation goal ( chart 6 ) and some of the policy rules shown in chart 7 .  the committee might agree with the staff âs assessment that recent developments in financial markets are unlikely to impose substantial restraint on aggregate demand , given that credit remains readily available to most households and businesses .  the committee might also agree with the staff âs view that , after a relatively brief interruption as the markets reassess credit risk , normal flows of credit probably will resume , though with risk spreads above the unusually low levels seen in the past few years .  even if the committee is class  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 21 of 43 less sanguine than the staff  , members might decide that more concrete information about the economic effect of less readily available credit would be needed to warrant a change in the stance of monetary policy .  moreover , the committee might judge that maintaining its current policy stance would provide a reasonable weighting of the risks to its dual objectives :   on the one hand , weakness in housing and strains in credit markets could have a more pronounced effect on overall economic activity than foreseen in the staff forecast ; on the other , the moderation in inflation may not be sustained .  the draft statement for alternative b reiterates the view that the economy is likely to continue expanding at a moderate pace over coming quarters .  however , by citing tighter credit conditions for some households and businesses , it also suggests somewhat greater downside risk to growth .  the draft acknowledges recent favorable readings on core inflation , characterizing them as â relatively subdued . â   at the same time , it points to continued upside inflation risk by repeating language from the june statement that â a sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated â and that â the high level of resource utilization has the potential to sustain those pressures . â  even if members judge that downside risks to growth have increased in recent weeks and that upside risks to inflation have diminished , they may still see the risks as unbalanced and thus want to indicate that the committee âs predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected .  taken as a whole , the language in alternative b is slightly softer than the june statement , but it also suggests that the committee does not expect the less accommodative conditions in credit markets to have a significant adverse effect on the economic expansion .  market participants see substantial odds of an easing of monetary policy in coming months but little chance of a rate cut at this meeting .  in responding to the desk âs survey , most primary dealers said they expect no more than minor class  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 22 of 43 modifications to the text of the accompanying statement , although one - third indicated they expect the committee to mention deteriorating financial conditions .  alternative  b seems generally consistent with those expectations , so a sizable market reaction to a statement such as that suggested in alternative b appears unlikely .  but markets might interpret the reference to tighter credit conditions for some households and businesses as a first step toward a possible easing , in which case the perceived probability of a rate cut in september would increase ."

( see box â financial indicators of recession risk . â )  the committee may be concerned that the housing correction could be more severe than anticipated by the staff , as explored in the â greater housing correction â alternative simulation in the greenbook .  members may also worry that a serious credit crunch could be emerging with economic consequences of the sort explored in the greenbook â bank capital crunch â scenario .  if asset - backed commercial paper programs draw even more heavily on bank backup liquidity lines and banks come to hold a large volume of leveraged loans and mortgages on their balance sheets , banks may tighten terms and standards for lending to households and businesses in order to conserve liquidity and balance sheet capacity .  continued market volatility or the emergence of news of losses could lead to solvency concerns about one or more major market participants , which would likely worsen counterparty credit concerns and interbank funding problems .  the committee may consider these class  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 27 of 49 financial indicators of recession risk some financial market observers consider the slope of the treasury yield curve to be a useful predictor of future macroeconomic conditions .  the yield curve had been inverted or flat until june and recently has steepened somewhat ; thus , by that measure , the risk of recession appears to have diminished in recent months .  however , spreads between corporate yields and comparable - maturity treasury yields also have had considerable statistical power in predicting recent recessions .  some of those credit spreads have surged over the past month to levels comparable to those reached in 1989 and 2000 .  thus , markets may be signaling high odds of imminent macroeconomic deterioration , despite the steepening of the treasury yield curve .  combining term and credit spreads in a logistic regression produces a model that performs well in â predicting â the last two recessions one year ahead while at the same time minimizing the number of false positives â that is , predictions of recessions that did not occur .  different measures of term and credit spreads produce slightly different results in this model , but a good fit is achieved â over the 1988 through 2006 estimation period  by using the spread on aa - rated five - year corporate bonds and the difference between ten- and two - year treasury  the august 2007 average values of these variables suggest a probability of about 40 percent that the u.s . economy will be in a recession in august 2008 .  this is the largest probability that the model has produced since late 2000 , and it is up from virtually zero earlier in the year .  if spreads during the first part of september were to persist for the remainder of the month , the estimated probability would rise to over 80 percent .  the apparently heightened risk of recession is notable , but some caveats are in order .  in particular , given the rather unprecedented nature of recent developments , it is possible that the term and credit spreads currently reflect different factors than they did prior to the previous two recessions .  moreover , the aa spread has risen more dramatically than some other credit spreads in recent weeks .  for example , high - yield bond spreads remained near their historical averages and thus continued to suggest less than 10 percent odds of a recession as of august .  although high - yield spreads have not previously performed as well in predicting business cycles as aa spreads , the sensitivity of the prediction to which credit spread is used indicates that the recent readings should be interpreted with care .  1 specifically , these two variables forecast recent recessions and expansions at least as well as alternative measures of term and credit spreads , based on both in- and out - of - sample tests .  t. b. ; levin , a. t ; and perli , r. , â financial market perceptions of recession risk . â   working paper , july 2007 .  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 28 of 49 risks sufficiently palpable to warrant a downward tilt to the balance of risks even after a half - point rate cut . -- second , alternative a states that credit conditions and the housing correction â appear likely to exert appreciable restraint â on growth , which is stronger than the statement that they have â the potential   . . . -- ( 25 ) a 50 basis point rate cut and the adoption of the statement language in alternative a would cause short - term interest rates to decline appreciably , as investors would be somewhat surprised by the magnitude of the policy action and would also infer that policy probably would be eased further ."

As with Alternative B, the effect on equity, credit and term funding markets is ambiguous, but the negative growth outlook in this alternative might well spook investors and cause stock prices to fall and risk spreads to rise. (27) In the draft statement accompanying Alternative C, the assessment of the outlook for growth and inflation would be identical to that in Alternative B, but the balance of risks would point to the downside."," financial conditions have deteriorated sharply on balance since the august 7 fomc meeting , making it more difficult and costly for households to class  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 24 of 49 obtain nonconforming mortgages and also leading to tighter credit conditions for some firms .  in addition , some nonfinancial indicators , including the august employment report , pending home sales , and anecdotal reports from contacts in private industry , suggest a weaker near - term outlook .  in view of these developments , the committee may judge that prospects for economic activity have deteriorated notably , and that the risk of a substantial and protracted slowdown in economic growth is now unacceptably large .   with such an outlook , and with inflation data continuing to be benign , members might see it as appropriate to counter the effect of tighter financial conditions by easing policy by 50 basis points at this meeting , as in alternative b .   if members judge that evolving circumstances will likely warrant easing policy by 50 basis points or more over the next several months , as in the staff forecast , then they might think it prudent to implement a half - percentage - point cut at this meeting .  the real federal funds rate is now about 50 basis points above its greenbook - consistent equilibrium value ( chart 5 ) and is also above the range of model - based equilibrium estimates , suggesting that a half - point easing in policy is unlikely to lead to unacceptable pressures on resources .  a 50 basis point rate cut is also consistent with the prescriptions of a number of simple policy rules , even with a 1Â½ percent inflation objective ( chart 7 ) .  a relatively aggressive easing of policy might also be viewed as valuable insurance against the risk of a further slide in investor and consumer confidence or a possible further deterioration in financial market conditions .  should such fears ultimately prove to be unfounded , and financial markets and the outlook for the economy improve , the committee might believe that it could act quickly to take back some or all of the easing .  the draft language of alternative b repeats the observation from the august 7 fomc statement that economic growth was moderate in the first half of the year .  however , it drops the assessment from the august 17 statement that â recent data suggest that the economy has continued to expand at a moderate pace ,  â class i  fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 25 of 49 as information that has subsequently become available suggests greater weakness in activity .  it then adapts language from the august 17 statement to note the potential dampening effect of financial market turmoil on the housing market and the growth outlook more generally .  the statement observes that the rate cut is intended to forestall the effects of these developments on the economy and to promote moderate growth â over time . â  this wording leaves open the possibility that growth may be weak for a time but suggests that the longer - term outlook remains healthy .  although this sentence does not literally express any asymmetry , analysts are likely to read the statement overall as indicating some predelication to ease policy further .  this approach could be seen as giving the committee flexibility going forward , either to ease further in response to soft incoming data or to stand pat if the economy appears to be stabilizing .  if members find alternative b attractive , but wish to adopt an explicit statement of balanced risks , then they might insert the sentence â after today âs action , the committee judges that the downside risks to economic growth are now roughly balanced by the upside risks to inflation â at the start of the assessment of risk paragraph .  measuring market expectations is especially challenging in the current environment , but investors appear to place substantial odds on two possible target rate decisions at this meetingâa quarter - point cut and a half - point cutâand seem to envision cumulative easing of 75 to 100 basis points by the end of this year .  with alternative b putting 50 basis points of easing in place and suggesting at least some possibility of further rate cuts , this alternative would likely prompt a modest decline in short - term interest rates and the foreign exchange value of the dollar might edge lower .  however , intermediate - term interest rates would probably change relatively class  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) page 26 of 49 little .  the effect on equity , credit , and term funding markets would depend on how investors interpreted the decision .  they would most likely conclude that the sizable policy response may offset some of the macroeconomic effects of credit market turmoil , leading equity prices to rally and risk spreads to narrow .  but it is possible that the relatively large policy move and the statement could lead investors to infer that the growth outlook is weaker than they had previously thought , having the opposite effect .  going forward , the reference to the committee closely following timely indicators may sharpen the sensitivity of markets to near -

term funding markets have eased somewhat , broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households .  moreover , incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets .  the committee expects inflation to moderate in coming quarters , but it will be necessary to continue to monitor inflation developments carefully .  appreciable downside risks to growth remain .  the committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks .  december 11 , 2007 statement 1 .  the federal open market committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points to 4 - 1/4 percent .  incoming information suggests that economic growth is slowing , reflecting the intensification of the housing correction and some softening in business and consumer spending .  moreover , strains in financial markets have increased in recent weeks .  today âs action , combined with the policy actions taken earlier , should help promote moderate growth over time .  readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year , but elevated energy and commodity prices , among other factors , may put upward pressure on inflation .  in this context , the committee judges that some inflation risks remain , and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully .  recent developments , including the deterioration in financial market conditions , have increased the uncertainty surrounding the outlook for economic growth and inflation .  the committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth .  i fomc - restricted - controlled ( fr ) 24 of 38 alternative b .  the staff forecast âs assumes that the funds rate is cut to 3 percent at this meeting and then maintained at that rate through 2009 ;  with that stance of policy , the unemployment rate remains about Â½ percentage point above the staff âs estimate of the nairu while core inflation edges just below 2 percent at the end of next year .  members might consider this combination of outcomes to be about the best feasible under current circumstances , reflecting the extent to which recent data have pointed towards a noticeable worsening of the short - run tradeoff between economic activity and inflation .  even if committee members are somewhat more optimistic than the staff regarding the modal outlook for economic activity , they may view this policy action as appropriate for mitigating the downside risks to growth that were emphasized in the january 22 fomc statement .  indeed , since investors â uncertainty about the economic outlook is apparently contributing to elevated credit spreads and dampened consumer and business spending , a substantial easing move at this meeting could bolster confidence that policymakers will act as needed to foster sustained growth and reduce the likelihood of adverse macroeconomic developments such as the greenbook  â recession â scenario .  however , policymakers may prefer at this stage not to take out further insurance by easing more than 50 basis points , given the possibility that such a move could induce an upward shift in the distribution of inflation outcomes over coming quarters , as illustrated by the â gradual reversal â scenario in the box on â risk management strategies . â   nonetheless , by explicitly noting that downside risks remain , the committee would suggest the possibility that substantial further easing could be needed in response to incoming information .  the statement under alternative b largely reiterates the rationale portion of the january 22 statement , including references to â considerable stress â in financial markets , tightening of credit conditions , deepening of the housing contraction , and some softening of labor markets , as well as restating the committee âs assessment of the prospects for inflation .  the final paragraph of the statement indicates that class  i fomc -

based rule percent civilian unemployment rate percent core pce inflation  four - quarter moving average risk management strategies simple policy rules can serve as useful benchmarks for monetary policy .  however , such rules are generally specified in terms of the modal forecast and hence abstract from risk management considerations .  in this box , we gauge the benefits and costs of alternative policy strategies using the version of the frb / us model in which expectations of the private sector are formed based on past economic data .  as a point of reference , suppose that the greenbook outlook is the best feasible   under current circumstances , at least in the absence of   uncertainty .  now consider the â recession â scenario presented in the greenbook alternative simulations .  when monetary policy is determined by the bluebook âs outcome - based rule ( dotted lines ) , the federal funds rate declines gradually in response to incoming data , reaching a trough of about Â¾ percent in late 2009 before returning to the greenbook baseline a few years later .  with this policy , the unemployment rate rises a bit above 6 percent next year and takes about five years to return to the nairu , while core pce inflation falls well below the assumed long - run inflation goal of 1Â¾ percent . if policymakers could instantly be sure that such a    recession was already in train , they might well cut the funds rate target immediately to a rate below 1 percent in order to reduce the severity of the downturn .  in reality , of course , economic turning points are notoriously difficult to predict or even to identify contemporaneously .  thus , policymakers might prefer to take out some insurance by easing the stance of policy even before the onset of recession was fully evident .  such an approach is illustrated by the risk management path ( solid lines ) , in which the funds rate target is reduced to 1Â½ percent for two quarters and thereafter   follows the prescriptions of the outcome - based rule .  this policy has visible effects in stabilizing economic    activity and inflation :   the unemployment rate at the peak of the recession is about Â¼ percentage point lower than in the absence of insurance , and the inflation rate stays noticeably closer to the assumed long - run inflation goal of 1Â¾ percent .  i fomc - restricted - controlled ( fr ) 26 of 38 risk management strategies ( continued ) percent federal funds rate costs of risk management gradual reversal prompt reversal greenbook baseline percent civilian unemployment rate percent core pce inflation four - quarter moving average it is also important to gauge the costs that would be incurred in following such a risk management strategy if in fact no recession occurs .  for this purpose , suppose that economic conditions unfold as in the greenbook baseline ( dotted lines ) but that policymakers have taken out some insurance against the risk of recession by lowering the target funds rate to 1Â½ percent for two quarters .  in the prompt reversal case ( solid lines ) , the strength of economic activity is assumed to be recognized quickly and the policy insurance is then removed ; indeed , policy is tightened somewhat further to offset the effects of the initial policy stimulus , and thereafter follows the prescriptions of the outcome - based rule .  in this case , the funds rate target rises almost a percentage point above the greenbook baseline path by the end of this year .  with this policy path , core inflation remains very close to the greenbook baseline while the unemployment rate only deviates temporarily .  in contrast , in the case of gradual reversal ( dashed lines ) , the strength of economic activity is assumed to become evident only over a longer period , and hence the policy insurance is removed over the course of a year rather than in a single quarter ; that is , after the first two quarters , the funds rate is adjusted according to the empirical outcome - based rule , which responds only gradually to incoming data .  this path of policy generates persistent deviations of unemployment and inflation from the greenbook baseline ; even at the end of 2012 , core inflation remains nearly a quarter point above the assumed long - run inflation goal of 1Â¾ percent .  i fomc - restricted - controlled ( fr ) 27 of 38 this policy action , combined with those taken earlier  , â should help to promote moderate growth over time and mitigate the risks to economic activity â but notes that â downside risks to growth remain â and emphasizes â as in the january 22 statement â that the committee â will act in a timely manner as needed to address those risks .  since investors assign most of the remaining probability to a smaller easing , the adoption of this alternative might cause a modest decrease in interest rates , a rally in equity prices , and perhaps some depreciation of the foreign exchange value of the dollar . -- as in alternative b , the risk assessment states that the stance of policy should help promote moderate growth and mitigate the downside risks to economic activity ."

( see the box â likely market interpretation of price stability language . â )   the change in wording , from reduced upside risks in the october 8 statement to an expected moderation of inflation in the language for alternative b , suggests that committee members have become much more confident that inflation will decline .  the final paragraph would note the numerous policy steps already taken in recent weeks to increase liquidity in financial markets , strengthen financial systems around the world , and promote economic class  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 34 of 45 growth .  while indicating that these actions should support economic activity going forward , the statement also notes that they have not eliminated downside risks .  the statement concludes with the final sentence of the october 8 statement , highlighting the committee  âs intention to act as needed in support of its objectives .  according to the desk âs survey on october 20 , primary dealers assigned roughly 40 percent probabilities to both 25 basis point and 50 basis point cuts in the federal funds target at this meeting , with a 20 percent probability of no change .  i fomc - restricted controlled ( fr ) 35 of 45 mean of dealers â expectations for the target funds rate was 1.2 percent , which is slightly above the rate of 1.1 percent implied by federal funds futures contracts at the time of the desk âs survey .  because futures contracts refer to the effective funds rate rather than the target rate , the difference between the dealer expectations and the futures rate may reflect the possibility that federal funds will continue to trade below the target in coming weeks ; 12 it is likely that at the time of the desk âs survey , both dealers and futures market participants expected a cut in the target funds rate of about 30 basis points .  however , over subsequent days , rates on federal funds futures contracts closing after the october meeting have declined another 10 basis points amid investor concerns about the economic outlook , and they now suggest expectations of about 40 basis points of easing at the upcoming meeting .  thus , a 25 basis point cut to 1Â¼ percent would leave the target federal funds rate somewhat above current market expectations .  nevertheless , the clear shift in the statement language away from concern about inflation risks and toward an emphasis on growth risks would likely lead investors to anticipate further rate cuts , and this alternative appears broadly consistent with readings for the funds rate at the end of the year that are implied by futures markets .   as a result , our best estimate is that adoption of alternative b would have only small effects on prices of financial assets . -- as under alternative b , the section also points out the likely future spending restraint implied by the further tightening of financial conditions ."
